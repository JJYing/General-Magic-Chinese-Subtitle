00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:55,750
[舒缓的背景音乐]

2
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:25,083
[Swisher] 在硅谷有很多关于起源的故事

3
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:29,417
这些故事里的公司，有着很正确的理念，但却完完全全

4
00:01:29,417 --> 00:01:34,750
诞生在了错误的时间，然而他们还是推动了所有事情的发展

5
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,125
[Markoff] 有很多故事定义了硅谷

6
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:43,208
世上有很多传奇，而 General Magic 就是其中一个

7
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:48,125
[Sculley] 你必须相信、必须要自豪

8
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:52,458
必须绝对地说服自己

9
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:54,917
你将改变世界运行的轨迹

10
00:01:54,917 --> 00:01:58,125
如果你一直待在安全区，也从未失败

11
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:02,333
那有很大可能就是碌碌无为度过一生

12
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:09,750
[Joanna] 无论我们的梦想多夸张，事实是你能
No matter how big we dreamed, the fact that you could touch

13
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,125
触碰到数以亿计的 the lives of billions, billions,

14
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:13,959
it was vaguely imaginable,

15
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:18,000
but the scale of it was inconceivable.

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,458
[Hershenson] 你为什么要关心 General Magic 的故事？

17
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:25,000
因为这个故事关系到现实世界里很基本的东西
is because it involves something fundamental,

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,667
那就是……失败兵不是一切的结束

19
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:31,875
失败其实是一个开始

20
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,000
[Hoffman] 这个故事至今萦绕在经历者们的心中

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
就是因为他们知道他们当时做的事情是正确的

22
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,917
[Hershenson] 它失败了？或者说，这个公司失败了，但这些想法没有

23
00:02:51,917 --> 00:02:56,375
为这些想法工作的人们没有失败，那……这件事算失败吗？

24
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:05,375
[戏剧性的配乐]

25
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:48,417
[铃声响起]

26
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,000
[Tony] 我当时正在念高中

27
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:27,125
应该是 16 岁吧当时

28
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:31,041
我完全不想上学，在家的日子只要一起床

29
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:35,000
就在电脑前，学习编程和一切跟电脑有关的东西

30
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,375
还跟我朋友讲这些，我是个极客，你知道吗，就是《菜鸟大反攻》里那种

31
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:45,458
从三四岁开始，每个周末我不是在造东西就是在拆东西

32
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:49,125
开过肥皂盒飞车，也修过割草机

33
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:55,166
但只有通过电脑，才能真正创造东西，原地坐在那儿就可以写出一个游戏

34
00:04:55,166 --> 00:05:00,250
或者生成一个计算机图形，就好像能够掌握一门只有自己懂的语言一样

35
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,875
当你把这些东西高速别人的时候，他们就会觉得「哇！」

36
00:05:04,542 --> 00:05:07,834
然后就是 Mac 了，一切都围绕这个 Mac 了

37
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,917
[低声耳语] 那是什么？

38
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:19,208
有很多响当当的名字：Andy Hertzfeld、Joanna Hoffman、Bill Atkinson

39
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:24,375
就想滚石乐队的成员们一样，只不过他们玩的不是音乐，他们是我心目中的英雄

40
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:28,500
我的名字叫 Andy Hertzfeld, 我在 1978 年买了 Apple II 并且爱上了它

41
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:35,250
然后在 1979 年开始为 Apple 工作，很幸运，参与设计了 Macintosh

42
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,375
你实在是很想去更多了解他们

43
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:40,208
想去和他们工作，因为我就像成为他们那样的人

44
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:45,625
[Vangelis 的著名配乐《烈火战车》响起]

45
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:48,208
[观众们在欢呼]

46
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:53,834
[程序化的声音] 你好，我是 Macintosh，从盒子里放出来的感觉，真好

47
00:05:53,834 --> 00:05:55,125
[观众们在欢呼]

48
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,625
1984 年 1 月 24 日

49
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:00,166
Macintosh 正式公开发布

50
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:03,709
第一次在世人面前揭开面纱
to the world, for the very first time.

51
00:06:03,709 --> 00:06:06,375
[Joanna] 你问我还记得什么？我就坐在那儿

52
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:13,542
听到人群在咆哮，就像声浪一样涌向我们

53
00:06:13,542 --> 00:06:19,417
那是多年工作的成果，也是大家多年的期待

54
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:20,583
就在那个时刻了

55
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:24,125
通过 Macintosh，我们努力想要去掉一个障碍

56
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:27,208
阻止普通人使用个人电脑的障碍

57
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,625
一个很明显的事情是，Macintosh 让我们有机会

58
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:32,500
彻底改变人们对于电脑的想法

59
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,291
我们把他叫做所有人的电脑

60
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:38,333
因为最早的时候普通人真的用不来

61
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:42,458
当时感觉我们有机会给这个世界带来一些不一样的东西
Steve Jobs 反复向我们灌输这些

62
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:45,041
他是一个杰出的激励者

63
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:48,083
厉害的人不需要太多管理

64
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,542
他们需要的是一个达成共识的愿景

65
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:53,750
当他们知道需要做什么的时候，会自己找到达成的方法

66
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,041
[Andy] 我们骨子里真的相信

67
00:06:57,041 --> 00:07:02,458
只要能解决电脑的可用性问题

68
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:05,875
让普通人都能轻松用起来

69
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,291
那我们真的就能改变这个世界

70
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,583
[Joanna] 但在这背后

71
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,792
在我们看不到的地方，事情正在发生变化

72
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:17,792
Steve Jobs 深陷政治斗争中

73
00:07:17,792 --> 00:07:20,792
发生的事情甚至大过 Mac 电脑

74
00:07:20,792 --> 00:07:24,959
我当时的眼光不够开阔，没法接受这些事情

75
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:27,959
[Andy] 我接到一个电话，大概是早上十点吧

76
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:33,458
是 Mac 开发团队的同事打给我的，
「你敢信吗？Steve 被解雇了！」

77
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:45,000
整个核心团队都懵掉了，这意味着事情彻底变成一团糟了

78
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,709
Steve 和 John Sculley 对于要做什么没有达成统一

79
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:52,333
当争斗积累到一定程度，董事会告诉 Sculley

80
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,709
他必须把 Steve 给踢出去

81
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:01,458
emm……对所有人来说都是非常痛苦的决定

82
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:05,250
无论是对 Steve 还是 Sculley，亦或所有跟他们很熟悉的人来说

83
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,792
[Joanna] Mac 之后

84
00:08:06,792 --> 00:08:09,834
我真的在想找点儿其他方向的事儿去做了

85
00:08:09,834 --> 00:08:13,375
-因为他确实让我们筋疲力尽，没法再抽身做其他事了
-[Andy] 是的

86
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:16,667
[Joanna] 其他项目不断地开始，但都像烟花一样快速熄灭了

87
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:19,625
因为他们都缺少宏伟的目标

88
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:23,834
缺少产生任何影响力的可能

89
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:25,291
那我们现在怎么办？

90
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,792
[柔和的音乐]

91
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:45,792
大家晚上好，我是 Marc Porat

92
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:48,750
现在很多人都相信，信息化工具

93
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:53,041
是能改变人类文明进程的第三种技术

94
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:57,291
改变人与自然之间的关系、人与人之间的关系

95
00:08:57,291 --> 00:09:00,000
改变我们对现实世界的体验

96
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,750
阿斯彭研究所吸引了不少最顶尖的人才

97
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,917
是一个让他们能私底下毫无保留自由讨论的地方

98
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:11,750
像是赛勒斯·万斯、亨利·基辛格，或者是伊朗的皇后

99
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:16,000
都是些非常非常有影响力的人物，你很难想象会见到他们

100
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,333
但他们就在那里教你东西，你可以

101
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:23,917
也事实上被授权负责开拓我们的未来

102
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:28,959
因为父辈那代交给我们的未来已经不存在了

103
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:35,750
所以我开始问自己「我能做点什么来创造未来？」

104
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:42,625
有那么一些瞬间，你感觉自己不知何故就在那个「未来」里

105
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:47,000
真真切切，你就是能看到自己

106
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,959
这种情况就发生在我身上，我当时感觉自己走进了未来

107
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:54,125
我看到了这个很真实的未来世界，甚至可以触摸到

108
00:09:54,125 --> 00:10:00,083
然后我在里面站了一会儿，看了一圈周围

109
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:04,792
它就在那儿，那基本上就是 General Magic 的愿景

110
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:14,375
我们要做的东西一定会非常具有革命性，会掌管整个世界

111
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:20,750
这本书是我 1989 年写的，基本上就是一本「点子」合集

112
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,333
我们把他叫做「Pocket Crystal 掌上水晶」

113
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:28,834
想到这个点子的时候是在 1989 年

114
00:10:30,834 --> 00:10:34,834
我们那么早就想到这个点子了[轻笑]

115
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:38,834
真的是我们想到的

116
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,500
[健身器材的噪音]

117
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:55,375
[John Sculley ── 前 Apple 公司 CEO]
商业其实就是讲故事，搞商业的人就是整天讲故事

118
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:59,500
故事讲得最有说服力的那些人
And they-- and the ones who tell the most compelling stories are the ones who,

119
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:04,834
往往就是最成功的人，Marc 就是个很棒的讲故事的人

120
00:11:04,834 --> 00:11:09,041
1985 年，在 Steve Jobs 离开之后，很多人非常沮丧

121
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:12,125
他们开始不太确定 Apple 的将来会变成什么样

122
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:15,458
离开 Steve Jobs 的 Apple 还能继续活下去吗？

123
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:19,875
其中 Marc 是最早看清楚未来的电脑是什么样的人

124
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:23,041
它不仅仅只是用来做计算，它会变成我们的通讯工具

125
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:25,875
它会变成我们消费的内容，也会变得非常非常个人化

126
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:28,333
甚至是小到可以塞进手里的东西

127
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:32,667
[Marc] 它是一个电话机，本质上就是一个智能手机

128
00:11:32,667 --> 00:11:35,625
非常非常的智能

129
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:38,333
想象一台个人电脑，里面装着各种应用程序

130
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,417
都是用来满足你的个人需求

131
00:11:40,417 --> 00:11:43,792
这个设备可以把你自己所有的想法都记录下来

132
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:48,709
也能让你和其他人联系起来

133
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:54,166
同样也能帮助你和整个世界连接起来

134
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:59,792
Marc 走到哪儿都带着他那本书，经常说着说着就开始翻起来

135
00:11:59,792 --> 00:12:03,959
emmm...他成功地说服了我

136
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:07,792
也说服了 Bill Atkinson 和 Andy Hertzfeld.

137
00:12:07,792 --> 00:12:09,542
[电话答录机] Please leave a message and we will return

138
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:11,875
your call as quickly as possible.

139
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:15,333
[Andy Hertzfeld ── Mac 开发团队核心成员]
我听见答录机上有一条来自 Bill Atkinson 的留言

140
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,500
他是我在 Apple 工作时的导师，也是我心目中的英雄

141
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,792
「我看到了一个前所未有的东西，

142
00:12:19,792 --> 00:12:22,417
你一定要回 Apple，跟我一起把他做出来」

143
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:27,417
然后第二天 Marc Porat 到我家里，展示了他的模型和其他东西

144
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:30,458
如果所有这些说不定哪天会有用的便条

145
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,250
都能随身携带，需要的时候直接能拿出来，那不是很棒吗？

146
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:38,291
就像重要的邮件，直接从天空中飞到你手边

147
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:43,041
[Andy] 我一开始还是很怀疑的，因为 Marc 看起来就是个很「商务」的人

148
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,542
但看了那东西之后，你别说，还真的挺酷的

149
00:12:45,542 --> 00:12:48,875
[Joanna] 我看到这个概念的时候，我跟 Marc 说

150
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,959
我感到很紧张不安

151
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:55,291
就很像第一次见到 Macintosh 的时候

152
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:59,375
那本书里，不止是点子

153
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:02,834
也不光是各种可能性

154
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:05,542
而是一个完整的收藏夹

155
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:09,333
收藏的都是关于未来的愿景，并且细节到一个个的场景

156
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:14,250
Marc 说：「我们要创造的是取代个人电脑的东西」

157
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,875
「John，我觉得这就是 Apple 的未来

158
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,125
但我不太确定这是不是可以在 Apple 内部做起来

159
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,208
我觉得它应该是一个独立的公司」

160
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:26,000
后来我帮 Marc 从 Apple 的董事会里拿到了投资

161
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,709
Apple 成功地把这部分独立了出去，就有了 General Magic

162
00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:33,333
这就是这家公司的开端，我觉得这是整个硅谷里

163
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:36,166
所有「默默无名」的公司里最最重要的一家

164
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:39,875
[轻快的音乐]

165
00:13:45,834 --> 00:13:47,667
那是一种微妙的神秘氛围

166
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:49,583
听说有一些人进这家公司了

167
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,208
一些非常厉害的人

168
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:55,083
[ John Markoff ── 纽约时报]
Apple 暗中给这家公司助力

169
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,709
而我们完全不知道它在做什么

170
00:13:56,709 --> 00:14:00,083
但有传闻说，他们要做的事情非常吸引人

171
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:03,333
有一家 Andy 和 Bill 都加入了的公司

172
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,542
他们打算大干一场

173
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:09,959
我都是就感觉「我不在乎他们做啥，我一定要加入他们！」

174
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:14,041
我把自己打扮得整整齐齐，穿上了西装系上领带

175
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,208
然后在早上大概八点半的时候到他们公司

176
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:19,250
我敲了门但没有反应，所以就直接打开了门进去了

177
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,208
里面非常安静，我当时在想「人呢？」

178
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:26,417
仔细看了一圈，有两个人在办公室里

179
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:31,083
他们在那里通宵了一整晚，当时茫然地看着我

180
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:36,792
看起来像是在说「我们这儿不招人」

181
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:41,250
[Stern] 硅谷的每个人都知道了 General Magic 在做一些很酷的事情

182
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,125
尽管并不清楚详细是什么

183
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:52,083
每个人都想要加入，真的有人会睡在他们公司门口

184
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,291
就为了获得一次面试的机会或者至少进他们那栋楼

185
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:57,041
[访谈主持] 从你的角度看，你们做的事情真的很特别吗？

186
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,125
还是说硅谷其他地方在做的事情都不酷？

187
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:02,250
不，不是这样的~

188
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:06,000
最厉害的人、最出名的人、最酷的人、最聪明的人

189
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
[Bill] Hi Megan，欢迎加入我们
[微笑]

190
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
来~ 笑一个~
你在我们的镜头里了

191
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,458
[Megan] 我一直在创造东西

192
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:18,542
我来自一个工程师家庭，所以很自然地就想要去硅谷

193
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:22,166
去跟着那些厉害的人学习怎么创造产品

194
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,709
做一些让人惊奇的事情出来

195
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:27,041
这些想法就一直驱使着我

196
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:36,458
Andy Hertzfeld 知道我是 Mac 的工程师，所以他给我打了电话让我加入

197
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:39,500
[Andy] 不好意思，但是我们必须要让你签一下这个保密协议……

198
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,917
他不能告诉我到底进去之后做什么，大我当时就在想

199
00:15:41,917 --> 00:15:44,041
「啊！我在跟 Andy Hertzfeld 说话啊！」

200
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,291
我父母当时觉得「我完全没听说过这个

201
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:53,750
叫『General Magic』的公司，你就不能去那些

202
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:58,417
像 IBM 或者微软这种我们都很熟悉的公司吗？」

203
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:01,333
我跟他们说「不要，我就是想去 General Magic」

204
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:05,250
他大概一天能给我打十个、十五个电话，就为了求我

205
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,625
「看一下我的简历吧~」

206
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,250
「你不让我去你们那儿上班，我就一直打」

207
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,667
[Tony] 终于我得到了一次面试机会

208
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:18,875
刚一坐下他们就把我的领带给扯掉，还脱掉了我的外套

209
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:23,333
「在我们这儿工作不用穿这些」
后来我就回到密西根的家里开始打包

210
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:26,000
不听到他们给我回复总觉得心里难受

211
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,417
所以我又打给 Dee
- 情况怎么样了？
- 我们是有流程的，还在推进中

212
00:16:30,417 --> 00:16:33,000
我们会安排一个会议让你过来聊，有消息了会通知你的

213
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,625
[Dee] 他还是不停地给我打电话

214
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,041
然后我就开始每天都打电话

215
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:40,667
我只能跟面试官说「给他打电话吧，我实在受不了他了」

216
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:43,125
<font color="#7e8979">电话铃声</font>
我接到一个电话「<b>恭喜你，你被录取了</b>」

217
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:46,458
当时我就疯了！

218
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:49,083

我们很懂用户怎么使用信息化设备，比任何人都懂

221
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:34,166
我们在产品开发早期的愿景就是

222
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:39,333
一台迷你的电脑，亦是一部电话机，非常个人化的物件

223
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,625
同时它必须落落大方

224
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:46,792
好似一件珠宝，给人以满足感

225
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:54,208
即使当它只是被放在那儿的时候，也没人能忽视

226
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:57,792
它应该像一块试金石，摸起来很舒服

00:17:57,792 --> 00:18:02,250
拥有贝壳和水晶那样另人愉悦的触感

228
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,542
一旦你用过一次，此生就无法放下了

229
00:18:10,569 --> 00:18:12,764
它绝不只是一部简简单单的电话机

230
00:18:14,611 --> 00:18:16,705
它一定会呈现出别样的形态

<font color="#ffffff"><b>Kara Swisher ── 记者、Recode 创始人: </b></font>
硅谷里很多人都觉得自己在改变这个世界

232
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,834
而且他们会反复跟别人这么说

233
00:18:26,834 --> 00:18:30,041
他们有时自称为「首席变革代理人」之类的

234
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:33,750
大部分时间都在瞎扯，但他们必须这么想

235
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,208
可能你实际上在做一个照片软件，这个没法真的改变世界

236
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:40,542
毕竟不是像治疗癌症、解决贫穷和改变气候变暖这样的大课题

237
00:18:40,542 --> 00:18:43,875
他们经常会夸大自己所做的东西和想法

238
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:46,625
但就像汽车和灯泡一样

239
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:50,458
一个在口袋里的电脑，真的是个很宏大的想法

240
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:54,125
设想中这个设备能让你自由访问任何东西

241
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,417
但在那时，还没有互联网

242
00:18:56,417 --> 00:18:58,917
没有一个全球互通的网络

243
00:18:58,917 --> 00:19:01,542
没有人用这个东西，手机也还没在世界上普及

244
00:19:01,542 --> 00:19:05,333
更没有 Wi-Fi，你懂的，这个没有，那个也没有

245
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:08,333
我开始报道他们是因为觉得

246
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:15,458
「哇！感觉未来就应该是这样的！」
这个移动中的计算机的想法就是诞生在 General Magic

247
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,792
- 快来看看，摩托罗拉的芯片寄到了~
- 耶~

248
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:19,917
- 耶，太棒了太棒了 

249
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:23,583
- 酷！

250
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,667
[笑声和交谈声]

251
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:31,542
你不断发现有新的人过来，比如

252
00:19:31,542 --> 00:19:33,875
Dan Winkler？他也来了？我知道 Dan

253
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:37,500
他每本书我都看过！还有 Scott Knaster，还有 Jimmy Freelander！

254
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,667
以及 Susan Kare，「他们都来了？」

255
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:41,583
Emmm……这里正在做什么呢？

256
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:44,333
我正在挑选一段范例影片

257
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:47,208
然后突然间 Andy Hertzfeld 走过来了

258
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:50,542
Joanna Hoffman 走过来了，我就感觉「我的天哪！」

259
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:54,125
这种感觉就好像你喜欢的摇滚明星来到你身边一样

260
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:58,250
- 还那么平易近人，就坐在地板上似的
- 嗨，你好~

261
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,542
不光是 Apple 在 80 年代最好的团队

262
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:05,875
整个 90 年代早期最好的团队也都在这里

263
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:08,208
团队里的人在爆发式增长

264
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,417
我一直想要更好地融入进去

265
00:20:11,417 --> 00:20:16,667
当时我还是一头长发，穿着底特律带过来的高领衣服

266
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:20,417
论资历我肯定是最浅的那个了，他们经常说「给他点工作让他试试看」

267
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:23,750
- 我担心这个芯片里有「虫子」
- 把你的手拿开~

268
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:28,250
[Amy] 一开始在工程方面进行研究

269
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,375
只是觉得这有可能让我找到一份谋生的工作

270
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,750
但是深入进去之后我发现，嘿

271
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:36,500
我还挺擅长设计集成电路的，这谁会想到呢？反正我想不到

272
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,375
我最想要的一个东西就是一种购物服务

273
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,667
从我的汽车方向盘上就能一键下单，买任何东西

274
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:44,583
[Megan] 普通人的二十几岁就是经常出去玩，每天泡在酒吧里

275
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:47,125
而我们的二十几岁完全不一样

276
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:52,959
全都在互相帮忙，创造各种与众不同的东西

277
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:57,540
-...the camera. -[indistinct chattering]

278
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:00,290
-[all] Ooh! -[woman] Tony, was that you?

279
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,750
You know, I hadn't had that many first days of jobs before

280
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:06,620
and I wondered, "Is the first day of every job like this?"

281
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,950
-The answer to that is no. -[Tony] Zed, the cell broke open.

282
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:13,120
我第一次见到了 Andy Hertzfeld，他那时候已经很有名了

283
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,700
所以我知道他长啥样， In my world he was one of the superstars, and it is a little embarrassing

284
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,200
to put it this way, but that was, that was pretty much like falling in love.

285
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,620
-[laughter] -OK! Let's-- let's try to, uh, start the meeting,

286
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:29,250
the-- the first, uh, the first obvious thing to mention is-- is

287
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:33,410
that we are not alone here today. we're being filmed for posterity.

288
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:37,330
It'll be a good historical or hysterical document, uh,

289
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,500
some time in the future anyway, and so...

290
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,160
Well, I was the black sheep. I was a filmmaker.

291
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,950
I'd never heard of a startup.

292
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:46,500
[Andy] I'm wired and wired for Sam here.

293
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,500
It shouldn't, it shouldn't be too disruptive.

294
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,790
[Hoffman] What I understood was that these people were

295
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,540
doing something so charmingly different,

296
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:57,910
so charmingly new. So...fun.

297
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:02,500
And you could trust them because what they were driven towards, wasn't a job,

298
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,910
the job never came up, the salary never came up.

299
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:09,250
It was where we were headed, we were going to change the world.

300
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:13,250
We all basically sat on the floor-- no, I did not. They all basically sat on the floor

301
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:19,580
to talk about what it was, what are we gonna call this handheld product.

302
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,790
We've been talking about possible names, what is the device?

303
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:26,950
One of the things that's really special is that it's in my pocket with me all the time.

304
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:31,540
It's a very different thing than computers. It's something that is in my pocket

305
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:34,700
and I run my life out of it and through it.

306
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,830
It was this notion of anytime, anywhere communication.

307
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:39,250
The notion that it wasn't just gonna be a phone,

308
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:42,370
but you could do all these other things with it, to integrate all that

309
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:44,000
into one thing that I could hold in my hand.

310
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,620
I thought, "Oh my god,

311
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,620
if I could have one of those."

312
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,750
I'm ready. And that was how things started.

313
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,620
-[interviewer] We're rolling. -Oh yeah?

314
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,080
[indistinct chatter]

315
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:59,580
-Show us what's in the box. -Uhm. OK.

316
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:03,250
We are trying to make something that people love. We need it to be like your watch,

317
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:07,450
you know, it feels like you're saying your watch, your glasses, your, your, um, your wallet.

318
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:10,330
Something that you like the color, you like the way it feels.

319
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:15,000
You know this is a huge, ugly thing, but, um, we had to start somewhere, we had to start

320
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,040
with components that we could buy off the shelf because you're--

321
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:22,620
you're working from, uh-- You're working from wishes and ideas

322
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,080
of how you wish it would be and real components

323
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,000
that you can buy that are cheap enough that you can make the product reasonable

324
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,790
so people can afford it because if it cost a million dollars, forget it.

325
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,950
[interviewer] Was that the first one or the begin-- in the beginning?

326
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:36,080
This is in the very beginning and, um, one of the problems with this,

327
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,120
was that the touchscreen was extremely noisy.

328
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,040
And it just didn't have the resolution, it would be a horrible experience

329
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,410
for people to use this thing. So that was actually our hardest component.

330
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:49,950
We were pushing the envelope on every single front,

331
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:53,160
so we're figuring out what size should it be, what sensor,

332
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:57,160
what electric plug should it have, how many buttons should we have if any.

333
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,290
[Kevin] The feeling was that anything was possible. You could shoot

334
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:03,830
as high as you wanted to here and as a team we were gonna be able to do it.

335
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:08,790
The purpose of doing all this, is to go out and-- and create prototypes

336
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:11,830
so that the team can plug them into the Mac and run the software

337
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:14,290
behind it and experience what a user would experience.

338
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:17,830
[Amy] The array of personalities, they were all like nuclear power plants,

339
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:21,200
each one of them working on solving these difficult problems.

340
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,000
For me the challenge was challenging myself to try and work at that level.

341
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,830
I was a newbie. A lot of people got to just do, you know, if you're the young guy in the team

342
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:33,000
you had to learn and do. So you had to work double or triple time.

343
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,290
He was our college kid.

344
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:37,950
[Tony] I'm hooking up a demo so that we can see

345
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,910
keyboards working with the device.

346
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:43,910
[Adler] Tony wanted to learn everything, from everyone.

347
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:47,750
Whatever it was, yes! And more of it and how can I do more to help.

348
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:50,830
-[interviewer] Is it important? -Uh, if you want to hook up disc drives

349
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:53,450
and things of that nature, yeah. It's really important.

350
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:57,200
[Tony] I wanted to make it work really seamlessly and fast.

351
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,660
This is basically our first test of our-- our-- basically a first demo

352
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:04,910
of our peripheral system for the-- for the walkabout.

353
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:09,790
And this was a technology to string peripherals together.

354
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:14,910
Today we call it USB, and so we were creating USB before the world knew about it.

355
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,870
-[woman whispering] Oh god. -[Tony] It finally works.

356
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:21,040
We decided to make everything. I mean, we were making it all.

357
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:25,330
See right now the whole class viewable texture is one formatter for everything.

358
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:30,200
That meant we were custom building every piece, it's kind of like hand assembling a car

359
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:35,040
rather than using a factory. And so it's, it's insane, it's insane.

360
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:40,120
In many projects, you might build one or two innovative break-out things,

361
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,370
and then you build on top of a lot of existing stuff, you kind of stand on

362
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:46,910
the shoulders of giants, and we weren't doing that at General Magic, we were

363
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:50,200
building the giant from the toes all the way up to its head. [chuckles]

364
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,750
We couldn't find a touch screen to solve this problem, in fact,

365
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:56,080
at one point, let me see if I can find it.

366
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,870
At one point, we had to invent one. [chuckles]

367
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:03,290
This Wendell, who works for Wendell Sander, he came up with this idea

368
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:06,040
of a touch screen that would be balanced on four points

369
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,200
and as you pushed on it you could, you could sense touch.

370
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,750
So as you touch it in any particular place,

371
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,000
you can do the math, so you do the whole force

372
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,950
minus the X and Y and you can figure out where you are.

373
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,410
Whether you are touching T or whether you're touching Caps Lock.

374
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:23,200
-[interviewer] How small will it finally be, do you think? -Some day?

375
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,120
Dick Tracy wrist watch, but... [chuckles]

376
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,330
Right now, in the beginning, we are starting with a screen size that's probably about that big.

377
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:35,330
Technically it was really, really hard to build something the size of those models.

378
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:39,040
Uh, the technology just wasn't there yet, but, hey, that was ok,

379
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,450
to build something a little clunkier for the first generation,

380
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:47,200
we knew, uh, if it caught on, it would eventually get down there.

381
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:51,870
[Adler] The touchscreen is a little funky.

382
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:54,040
What was this thing gonna look like? You know, we knew what size screen

383
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,790
we were gonna have, but we didn't know that early

384
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:58,200
everything we're gonna put on that screen.

385
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,660
The thing about computer programming

386
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,580
is you're making something out of nothing.

387
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,950
[cameraman] This is not nerds creating for others nerds here.

388
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:07,950
There is a creative process here that is much like

389
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:10,160
making a film or painting a picture or doing a play.

390
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,410
This is very creative, which is a surprise to a lot of people.

391
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:15,750
-This is a very creative process. -[producer] You mean artistic?

392
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,660
-Artistic? You mean artistic. -Yeah.

393
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,500
I'll ask him about them, OK?

394
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,700
Yeah, that's absolut-- that got the crew yesterday.

395
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,790
The common ground between Apple and what we did

396
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:28,160
at General Magic in the sixties was idealism.

397
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,830
Our art could make a difference in, in the lives of everyone,

398
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:35,330
everyone you know and everyone you don't know.

399
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:39,660
I think, uh, communications is the most fundamentally human thing that we do,

400
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:44,620
and that's really why what we are doing cuts to the heart of-- of-- of who we are.

401
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:49,290
Uh, that's what distinguishes people more than any other thing I think, the, uh,

402
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:55,040
the sense of community, a sense of, of, reaching out from yourself to someone else.

403
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,950
One of the things Bill and I do is just by word of mouth passing, passing

404
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:02,500
that spirit down, down to the next generation.

405
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,330
We were always saying, wow, wouldn't it be great if we did that and Andy would do this,

406
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:09,700
he would stay up all night coding the thing that we just came up with

407
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:13,000
the idea that evening. He would stay up all night and bring in

408
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,080
a fully working thing the next morning.

409
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,700
[Kevin] So we created this concept of different rooms, and Andy went off

410
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,500
and over the weekend he completely rewrote the system

411
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:28,370
to implement this hallways thing. So we come back and it's all there.

412
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:32,950
That shouldn't have been possible for one person to do that much work in one go.

413
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:36,450
[Adler] Passion is the thing that breaks through logic

414
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:39,750
and makes you try to get every part right,

415
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:43,750
not because of some science, but because of

416
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:48,250
your feeling of pride and desire to do something great.

417
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:51,870
[Andy] All you have to do is tap on this little letter creating icon

418
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:54,120
and, uh, your favorite stationary pops out

419
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,910
of the drawer. You notice it looks like a little postcard.

420
00:28:56,910 --> 00:29:00,660
[Joanna] There was mail, there was calendar, everything was communicating

421
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:04,000
with each other and tiny little things that would delight people

422
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,660
that would wink at people that would just make it so special.

423
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:13,120
One interesting area we-- we haven't done is-- is expressing emotions.

424
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,000
Uh, what-- what extent would you use to express anger at someone.

425
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,200
[Marc] Emoticons, today, emoticons are a big deal.

426
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,830
In those days no one knew what it was, there was no such thing.

427
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:25,290
Andy and Bill would disappear and come back with emoticons

428
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:29,120
that were animated. They were amazingly cute and intelligent.

429
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,200
Only one person hated the happy face. It's like--

430
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,290
-Who was that? -[laughter]

431
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:38,250
[Adler] I've certainly never worked with a team as ambitious. It's almost like

432
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:42,790
we didn't care about what made sense. You know, how else could it be good enough?

433
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:46,120
There was, uh, confidence, even arrogance there too.

434
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,540
[Tony] Are you kidding me? This is, this is fun!

435
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:52,660
[Amy] It was like we could walk through walls and do anything.

436
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,950
[Tony] Being there with all these people who were like, "We can change the world

437
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:58,830
and we're going to do it and let me show you how."

438
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:02,160
[Hoffman] They were on a joy ride, a rocket ride

439
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:05,080
with all the freedom to do what they wanted to do.

440
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,910
Now it's getting them to understand this thing costs money.

441
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,040
Real money.

442
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:21,870
In 1990 there was no digital telecommunications industry.

443
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:24,950
It did not exist, anywhere in the world.

444
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:28,120
We were in the analog era, there were no

445
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,330
digital cellphones, there was no World Wide Web.

446
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,830
[Stern] We were talking about bringing millions of people onto a network

447
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:36,910
that had to be industrial strength, reliable,

448
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:40,200
and run 24 by 7 by 365 with no glitches.

449
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,700
Who else could do that, but the telephone company?

450
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,950
That's who we needed, and that meant AT&T.

451
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:53,200
[Michael] The AT&T folks came in this gigantic stretched limo that was too big

452
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,540
to get into the parking lot and I was watching them out of the window

453
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:58,250
of the second floor conference room. Watching them trying to maneuver the car

454
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:03,200
into the parking lot. They just couldn't do it.

455
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,620
So they eventually got out of their car and they trouped upstairs.

456
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:09,040
We're still waiting for Bill and people are staring at their shoes

457
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:12,200
and a little uncomfortable. That was not a good start.

458
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,250
-Um... -[woman] What happened?

459
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:18,120
So Bill finally shows up. Um, he hadn't taken a shower in a week.

460
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:22,540
He was wearing a Hawaiian shirt, he stunk like a goat.

461
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,660
You could see the noses wrinkle on the faces of the three AT&T guys,

462
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,750
but they launched the demo.

463
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:30,080
-[AT&T] This is a touchscreen? So I can ahead go and touch it. -[Andy] Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

464
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,080
[Stern] No one had ever thought of the kind of ideas

465
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,000
that Marc, Bill and Andy had instantiated in this demo.

466
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,870
...another step. Would you like a cookie?

467
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:39,790
-Oh no. I've eaten too many. -Would you like a cookie?

468
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:45,450
The AT&T folks said, "We're in," and they joined us as the first network partner.

469
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:50,580
[Hoffman] You got to have AT&T, you got to have Apple,

470
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,160
that's your roots.

471
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,750
You got to have Motorola and Sony, they make the devices.

472
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,080
And you got to have Phillips.

473
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,200
They're also gonna make devices.

474
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,120
Without those, we couldn't have been General Magic.

475
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,950
[Stern] And we charged them six million dollars for the privilege of joining... each.

476
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:12,250
Here was this little startup in Silicon Valley, that was gonna change the world,

477
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:16,120
everybody was afraid of being left out of the vision.

478
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,750
This company's scale is small, but thinking so big.

479
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:22,660
Immediately we decided to join it

480
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:26,410
Yes, just, boom, one second, we decided.

481
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:31,450
[Joanna] Sony Japan was unbelievably great, but I think one of the things

482
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:38,290
that Marc underestimated is how each one of those relationships

483
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,290
contributed to an enormous level of complexity.

484
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:44,370
...he said we have these three bears out there, and we call them Goldilocks.

485
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:47,200
-We're gonna dance with the three bears. -[laughter]

486
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,500
-[Andy] Marc is Goldilocks. -I find him, grraawr, grraawr!

487
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,410
-[laughter] -Gurrhr!

488
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:54,700
I thought you grraawr, grraawr!

489
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,120
[Marc] The vision was gonna happen because we were putting together

490
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,330
16 of the largest companies on the planet

491
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:03,160
who are natural enemies, into-- into the same room at the same time.

492
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,450
We knew we were innovating, no one had done anything like that, and if it succeeded

493
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:13,790
it would change everything and that took a war-like energy.

494
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:17,160
That was fighting, that was battle.

495
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:21,410
[calm music]

496
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:24,910
[Sculley] We had no choice, but to keep quiet about the things we were doing

497
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:30,540
because other companies were interested in it as well, and we tried to keep secrecy

498
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:37,450
at a level that would give a small company like General Magic time to create, time to develop.

499
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:42,750
[Dee] Everybody had to shred everything. We couldn't put everything in one bin.

500
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:49,120
We had to wait and-- and kind of dole it out to various different places.

501
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,200
We were asked not to talk about it outside

502
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,040
of the office because we didn't want any of it leaked.

503
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:58,040
So there was this buzz around the company, but it really was kind of this, this, cipher.

504
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:02,200
We had to keep it under wraps. Part of that was this PR strategy

505
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,910
that we had only one shot to make news.

506
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:10,450
[Marc] "While we're in business development stage, security is essential.

507
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:13,620
If the concept leaks, we lose our competitive edge.

508
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:18,410
Please use the highest level of personal attention to security, including,

509
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:22,290
if asked by an Apple colleague not on the team, say nothing.

510
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:24,910
If asked by a non-Apple person, tell me immediately."

511
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:29,500
Now it should be noted, John Sculley was running Apple at the time.

512
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:35,120
[Joanna] In that sense he was our ally, or so we thought.

513
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:46,290
I was getting intense pressure from the Apple board and from the Apple management team

514
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:49,450
as to why was I spending so much time on General Magic.

515
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:54,450
And Apple was developing in parallel a business that it owned 100% of,

516
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:58,290
called Newton, and that looked like they could ship a product.

517
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:04,660
Ten years ago we launched Macintosh, a revolution for the desktop.

518
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:09,200
And today we are launching Newton, a revolution for the pocket.

519
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,660
John Sculley gave a keynote address at the 1993

520
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:17,790
consumer electronic shows where he announced what we were doing.

521
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:22,450
Imagine being able to take a cellular telephone and be able to be paged

522
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:26,910
on the phone and write a little note and fax it off to someone else in response.

523
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:32,330
Except he announced it as something Apple was doing. We thought Apple wasn't doing it

524
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,910
and we found out from that speech that they were.

525
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:38,370
I wish I could say that I was hurt. I wasn't--

526
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:42,160
I wasn't just hurt, I was angry. I was fur-- I was really angry.

527
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,370
[Andy] They had, uh, decided to make something

528
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:48,000
essentially based on Marc's models.

529
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,160
I thought Newton was, I thought that they could co-exist, you know.

530
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:58,500
And, so I wasn't really concerned that Newton would hurt General Magic.

531
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:03,330
They were our closest partner who really gave us our life.

532
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:09,950
And so when we found out that they were trying to kill us, we felt completely betrayed.

533
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:15,250
You wanna know about the Newton? I'll tell you about the Newton, #### the Newton.

534
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:22,290
[Joanna] The Newton announcement caused vision envy

535
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:24,620
on the part of all of our partners.

536
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:28,540
They thought that Sculley's was bigger than theirs.

537
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:32,040
"I want that vision thing. Do that vision thing for me too."

538
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:36,580
And so they wanted to immediately go up there and introduce.

539
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:40,580
[Hoffman] We've got to explain the vision such that everybody gets it.

540
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:44,370
The press gets it, the corporations get it, it's all clear.

541
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,700
[女声] Leading the way to a new age of personal communication,

542
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:56,000
creating a revolutionary electronic messaging environment.

543
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,080
We call this environment, the Cloud.

544
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,750
[Stern] The fact that the Newton was going to ship and it was getting

545
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:04,870
all this publicity meant that we had to come out of stealth mode

546
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:08,660
earlier than we had planned and well before we were ready to ship.

547
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:12,620
Stakes are higher, you better be better than these guys.

548
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:16,250
[Marc] Big event? This was huge and we made it huge

549
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:18,330
on purpose to raise the jeopardy.

550
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:22,250
We knew it was gonna be a marathon that we were gonna run at sprint speed.

551
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:27,410
It was gonna take everything out of us. Down the torpedoes, it's full speed ahead.

552
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:33,620
This is it, we're coming, these amazing devices.

553
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:36,790
[dramatic music]

554
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,790
-[Markoff] You remember much about that day? -[Saffo] Yeah, well,

555
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:45,620
I remember my impression of Marc was, "Huh,

556
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:50,790
most of the vision of Jobs, but he had better interface".

557
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:52,790
[announcer] Presenting Marc Porat.

558
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:54,290
[audience applauding]

559
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:56,120
Today we are going to introduce the vision.

560
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:00,450
Today we are introducing the technology, introducing The Alliance.

561
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:02,790
But let it be said it's about feelings.

562
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:07,450
How you feel about the communication with another person.

563
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:10,660
To me the relationships of your life, is the fabric of your life.

564
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:14,250
That's the stuff that defines who we are as people.

565
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,160
[MacAskill] Marc was one of the most charismatic presenters you could ever imagine.

566
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:21,450
But let me just hold it up for you, so you can see what this thing is, you know, about.

567
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:23,500
Its intent is to be with me all the time.

568
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,830
The thing about Porat when he speaks is, everybody in the audience

569
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:31,000
says to themselves two things, they say, "My god this guy is right.

570
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,580
I can go to the roof of this building and if I jump, I will fly."

571
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:40,620
And the second thing they would think is, "And that guy up there on stage,

572
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:44,620
and me, we're the only two guys who really get it."

573
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:48,370
This, we hope will be with you as simply part of your existence.

574
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:52,120
It will be that useful. The minute I see it in a store, I smile.

575
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,580
It's about having fun, it's about leisure, it's about entertainment.

576
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:59,290
I just recall listening to him and thinking, "Yes, yes!"

577
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:04,370
When we were talking about re-inventing telephony, we meant it. This is inexorable.

578
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:08,120
The world of personal communications, when it's fulfilled, uh, possibly

579
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:12,290
in one generation, when I say generation, I mean my children, my son and daughter.

580
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:14,500
When they walk around with these things they will be wireless.

581
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,370
[Hershenson] Reporters would leave these briefings saying,

582
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:20,000
"My god, uh, forget the story I'm writing, I want that.

583
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,700
The world that they just described to me,

584
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:25,700
I want to live in that world, I want my kids to live in that world."

585
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,870
[reporter 1] A tiny gadget that combines the telephone,

586
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:31,620
a fax machine, and a personal computer.

587
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:34,250
Cellular phone, a pocket pager and a notepad.

588
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:37,160
Sounds a bit like something from Star Trek, you can send and receive messages,

589
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:42,250
order tickets, get the latest headlines or stock quotes and also you can talk on it.

590
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:46,660
It was wall to wall coverage. New York times, Wall Street Journal, L.A. Times.

591
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,580
[Hoffman] It was front page in the Economist,

592
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:51,540
front page on the Wall Street Journal. No small thing.

593
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:54,620
[reporter] If this works the way this industry wants it to work,

594
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:57,950
this is going to be huge, I mean, you are talking about

595
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:01,370
the potential for hundreds of millions of devices eventually.

596
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:05,700
IBM is conspicuously absent from the alliance. So is Microsoft,

597
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:10,250
which is racing to develop its own personal communicating software standard.

598
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:15,700
[reporter] Some say it's revolutionary. Others simply say it's magic.

599
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,700
So we got a ton of coverage, a ton of coverage,

600
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:21,160
and that's also where, the first questions where,

601
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,790
"Well, this is, this is huge.

602
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:26,000
Are they going to be able to actually fulfill on that vision?"

603
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,910
[radio host] Marc Porat the President and CEO and co-founder of General Magic.

604
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:34,660
Thank you very much for being here. What do you see as your-- your startup date

605
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:37,450
to actually have one of these things in somebody's hand?

606
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:40,290
[Marc Porat on the phone] We'll be talking about dates and about product features

607
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:43,620
in some detail this summer, but I did want to have a chance to answer your--

608
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,830
In other words nobody is saying when one of these is gonna be available?

609
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:47,620
-[Marc Porat] That's correct. -OK, OK. So--

610
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:50,450
[Marc] I caution-- I-- I-- I counsel caution...

611
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:54,250
[Adler] ...written record of it. Um, but what we have, we have sort of...

612
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:57,000
It did not go smoothly after that at all.

613
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,200
Moments where somebody has to start doing something and, uh, what we have decided is

614
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,750
that for each of those important moments we want to make sure that there is

615
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:06,950
real responsibility for someone to, you know, to-- to say,

616
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:09,250
"I am at this important moment, you'll start doing your work."

617
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:14,330
Marc and Bill and Andy together decided, "Well, this is the person

618
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:18,660
to manage the engineering team." That's what they-- that's what they wanted me to do.

619
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,830
And then there was this one day where I came to talk to all of them

620
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:24,120
at once and they said, "Oh we don't need a manager.

621
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:28,450
We don't want you, because we don't need a manager. Our leader, our leaders

622
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:33,160
are Andy and Bill. Uh, that's what makes this place great, is we don't have managers."

623
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:37,120
[Tony] "We can be engineers without a manager and we know what's best.

624
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:41,000
Managers are just going to get in the way. We don't need program managers,

625
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,660
we don't need any of that stuff. We are just going to make it happen."

626
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,700
[engine revving]

627
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:53,830
[Marc] There was a fearlessness and a sense of correctness,

628
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:58,370
no questioning of "Could I be wrong?" None.

629
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:01,540
Because that's what you need to break out of earth's gravity,

630
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:04,660
you need-- you need an enormous amount of momentum.

631
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:08,160
And that momentum comes from suppressing introspection

632
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,580
about the possibility of failure.

633
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:14,830
[Stern] The Alliance was the biggest and most complicated

634
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:17,700
consortium of global companies that had been created

635
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,370
up until that time in American business.

636
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,580
You had competitors at the table.

637
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,580
Sony and Panasonic hated each other,

638
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:24,250
and it made it hard for them to commit

639
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,120
fully to our business.

640
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,950
We needed to become independent,

641
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:29,330
and the only way we could do that

642
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:31,750
was buy selling stock to the public.

643
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:34,700
It was the first, so called, concept IPO,

644
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:37,200
which is when a company could go public without any revenue,

645
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,950
let alone any profits.

646
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:42,660
What made that possible? The imprimatur of Goldman Sachs.

647
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:49,370
Goldman Sachs was the gold standard for investment banking.

648
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:55,410
If Goldman was going to do your initial public offering, it meant that you too

649
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:59,790
met the gold standard for being a real company with real prospects.

650
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:02,040
Didn't have a product, didn't have a revenue stream,

651
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,910
but, you know, it seemed cool at the time, let's invest.

652
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:07,660
[Marc] The best investment bankers came to pitch us.

653
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:13,450
One of them came and said, "I must have a piece of the IPO.

654
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:17,000
What would it take, what-- if I gave you the shirt off my back, would that do it?

655
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,830
And I said, "Yeah. It would!" And he stripped down...

656
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:24,120
- 别拍这个 - [笑] - Don't film this stuff. -[laughter]

657
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:27,620
[Marc] And there we were standing in the conference room with a half-naked banker.

658
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:30,250
He got the deal, he participated in the IPO.

659
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:33,790
[indistinct chatter]

660
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:35,620
Where is that [indistinct] happening?

661
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:39,660
Right here.

662
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:46,450
So then they didn't make any 44260s in five volts without this, right, enable thing?

663
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:50,250
[Megan] Probably the most challenging part of the product was deciding what not to do.

664
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:53,160
What to do and what not to do, because it's really hard, you're building

665
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:58,290
a very complex platform. And so just often things would take longer.

666
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:02,160
For me, I had never done anything like that. It was a huge challenge.

667
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,870
You really had to work very hard to build what we were trying to build.

668
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:12,580
I really had to up my game and they were all like, "Fadell you're doing it wrong.

669
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:15,660
You should be doing it that way." And I'm like, "No, I think it's the right way."

670
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:18,160
But I couldn't really articulate the way they could. So yeah,

671
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:22,330
-I had to challenge myself and kinda go into the dark hole. -A3 Volts...

672
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:25,700
[Megan] Once we got the basics there, you take the new chip that had

673
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:29,750
whatever the latest software that everybody had put together,

674
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:33,290
pop it in and begin to see the screen come to life.

675
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:37,000
[keyboard clicking]

676
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,370
[Amy] We could see it, we could touch it and feel it.

677
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:46,080
But the responsiveness of the device was really slow. Uh, the processor was underpowered,

678
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:52,370
for example. So the experience was a bit tap... tap...

679
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:54,450
And, you know, kind of annoying.

680
00:44:56,370 --> 00:45:00,080
I was sitting in a lot of the user test labs.

681
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:03,040
The engineers would sit there and say, "No, lady, what are you doing?

682
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,080
Don't, don't tap that. No, it's not there, it's over there!"

683
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,080
And we'd all go, "Ooh." There was some comedy there.

684
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:12,080
[woman 1] The thing at the bottom that kinda looks like a comb,

685
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:15,910
I haven't the slightest idea what that is.

686
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:17,660
[man] This doesn't look like it's working.

687
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,540
-[chimes] -[woman] Is this noise supposed to be here?

688
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,910
-[engineer] OK, we've crashed. We just crashed. -[woman] Uh-oh.

689
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:24,080
[Hershenson] It had this little top hat.

690
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:26,540
Like some operating systems had little spinning wheels

691
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:28,910
or a top hat would just start spinning.

692
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:30,950
And just start spinning and just keep spinning.

693
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:33,540
You just stare at this ####### thing.

694
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:36,250
Finally you just pull out the battery and reset the device,

695
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:38,330
because there is no point in waiting.

696
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:41,750
-[beeping] -[indistinct] target for re-bunking.

697
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:44,580
[engineer] It's not my fault, is it? It's the software engineer.

698
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:49,200
And, you know, it's slowly dawning on us, like we are not gonna get this done.

699
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,000
[woman 1] This isn't a finished program by any means, is it?

700
00:45:57,950 --> 00:46:01,160
[Stern] The roadshow for the General Magic public offering

701
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:04,790
was flying around in a private jet, flying first class,

702
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:10,290
staying in the best hotels and having people sit at our feet and lap up what we were saying.

703
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:12,620
The closest thing it comes to is touring with a rock band.

704
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:16,120
We've got a roadie crew that has to set up the cameras and the big screen

705
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,700
to make sure that people can see the demonstration of the device.

706
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:24,580
What we envisioned is something in your hand that's with you all the time, that allows you

707
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:29,620
to have access whether it's for fun or more importantly for mission critical applications.

708
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,330
[audience applauding]

709
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,700
All we did was demonstrate the device.

710
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:38,790
I would go out in the hallway and I would pretend to be an airline company

711
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:44,160
and Marc would make an airline reservation, and in real time, Marc would reserve a flight,

712
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,660
and blow people away because no one had ever seen anything like it.

713
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:49,950
We've got tools, we've got partners.

714
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:51,540
We've got markets that are happening all around us.

715
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,620
-Give us a clap. -[audience applauding]

716
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:56,580
Great. That's the right stuff.

717
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:01,330
[Stern] The roadshow succeeded beyond everybody's wild expectations.

718
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:04,200
The first concept public offering in Silicon Valley history

719
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:08,950
and we raised a total of, uh, 96 million dollars.

720
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:09,870
That's about as good as it gets.

721
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,040
We were kings of the universe, and it was really fun.

722
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:23,410
[Marc] Today we would call it going viral. The press loved us.

723
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:26,370
They heard the vision, they saw what was going on, and whoop! They're in.

724
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:29,700
[MacAskill] I was just afraid Marc thought things were just too easy to do.

725
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:32,370
How are you gonna get the price point? How are you gonna keep it from crashing?

726
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:34,870
How are you gonna make it fast enough? How are you gonna make it readable?

727
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:37,200
I just didn't think he was focused on that stuff.

728
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:41,200
[Tony] We were so distracted by all the articles,

729
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:45,410
that we started to believe our own-- our own tale.

730
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:48,790
You know that we're gonna conquer the world, but yet we hadn't finished.

731
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:53,290
We were not paying attention to the other external trends that were happening around us,

732
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:56,540
because we were aiming so far out in the future. It was like the--

733
00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:00,080
the current context around us really wasn't considered that relevant,

734
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:04,450
because we were aiming to far out. But boy was that relevant.

735
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:09,580
[modem connecting sound]

736
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:13,580
[TV announcer 1] Put simply the internet is just a network of networks.

737
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:16,750
[TV announcer] In recent years, a relatively unknown communication system,

738
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:20,790
called the Internet, has exploded in popularity with such intensity

739
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:26,000
that it's predicted that over 25 million people will be using it by the year 1998...

740
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,790
And we had an intern who's like, "Hey everybody,

741
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:32,040
it's all about the Web. You guys are totally missing it." He was telling us this.

742
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:36,580
It was probably late 94' early 95' and you could go to every Website at that time.

743
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,290
There was a list of them and you could go and visit all of the Websites.

744
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:42,870
And it was all very rough, you know there was mostly text.

745
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:48,290
Uh, having graphics was leading edge and we were working on this rich multimedia system

746
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:53,370
with audio and graphics and things animating and the richness was far beyond

747
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:57,790
what the web was, but the web had-- had worldwide reach.

748
00:48:57,790 --> 00:49:01,290
[Amy] This other force had appeared and we weren't looking at it, you know.

749
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:04,450
We were in bed with AT&T with our private cloud.

750
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:09,250
The whole point about having a closed network is that people had to pay to use it,

751
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:11,830
and that's where AT&T was going to generate it's revenue.

752
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:18,290
The problem was pivoting toward the World Wide Web, that would have meant cannibalizing

753
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:23,370
or perhaps even wrecking AT&T's business model and we just couldn't do it.

754
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:28,870
I have to invest the time, the time to keep banging on the web

755
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:34,330
with my mouse and my keyboard because unless I do that nothing happens. The web is passive.

756
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:37,620
[Stern] But even though it was all here, right in front of us,

757
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:41,500
we were unable to see that was the way to go.

758
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:46,540
[lively music]

759
00:49:55,660 --> 00:50:00,410
[MacAskill] One of our developers, Pierre Omidyar, very quiet, soft spoken guy.

760
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:04,750
He had a Webpage, and down at the bottom it had a click through called Auction Web.

761
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:07,080
Every once in a while I would pass his desk

762
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,620
and he would go, "Dee, come over here, let me show you this."

763
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:13,120
So he would show me what he was doing and of course he explained it as

764
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:16,370
it was gonna be kind of a garage sale, flea market,

765
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:21,540
kind of site. OK, why do we need that? And so... [chuckling]

766
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:23,910
[Stern] And he came to me and said, "Do you wanna help grow it?

767
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:26,910
You know, is it something you think is a good idea? I'd like to turn it into a--

768
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:30,370
into a company possibly. Would you help me spin it out?" I just looked at him and said,

769
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:33,370
"You know, this is the dumbest idea I've ever heard.

770
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:35,370
You're gonna get strangers to trust each other on the Internet?

771
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:38,450
Lots of luck. We're not interested, have fun."

772
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:43,910
[lively music]

773
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:46,870
[MacAskill] He tried to get lots of people to join and nobody would join

774
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:50,250
'cause they just thought it was a flea market. I took him down to an investor conference

775
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:54,410
in Palm Springs, so I got 15 people in there and seven of them left

776
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:56,750
during his presentation, because it was a long, boring presentation.

777
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:59,500
He had this pony tail down to his waist. He didn't look like the kind of guy

778
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:02,910
who was the CEO of any kind of company. Some investors said never do that to me again

779
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:07,330
because that's flea market, you could never make a good brand out of that.

780
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:09,370
-And that's how eBay was launched. -[chimes]

781
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:12,540
[MacAskill] We had him in our midst, and we had no idea.

782
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:17,120
He was, he was a tech support engineer and a very quiet guy. We had no idea.

783
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:23,410
[Hershenson] Meanwhile we are hearing about, you know, the partners

784
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:26,080
need a final version to put in the ROMS to ship.

785
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,500
[Andy] Any deferral of schedule is very politically charged,

786
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:33,040
so what we decided to do was just remove the schedule from that information pack.

787
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:37,200
Sony was just, you know, insistent about that, like, "Where is it? Where is it?"

788
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:42,200
And there's only so many excuses you can come up with to try to put them off to say, you know,

789
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:46,160
"Just a little bit longer, just a little bit longer." They're losing patience.

790
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,790
[General Magic engineer] Hope to deliver that by December 1st.

791
00:51:48,790 --> 00:51:52,910
Uh, we're still evaluating that, to see whether we can meet that date.

792
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:55,250
And then we started blowing schedules.

793
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:57,330
It's... uh, it's in development right now.

794
00:51:57,330 --> 00:52:00,450
We expect to be delayed by approximately one quarter.

795
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,120
-What is going on here? -[GM engineer] I've just gotten a little sick

796
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,790
of all this complaining about our schedule slips, dammit. We do a good job here.

797
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:10,370
We are a little slow sometimes and we have a lot of bugs, but so what?

798
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:13,750
I started to understand where the cracks were starting to begin

799
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:17,500
and where we didn't have a real message, and a real clear what we were building,

800
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:20,250
and what we weren't building, and for whom, and for how much

801
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:22,660
was it gonna cost, and when it was going to ship.

802
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:25,500
[Andy] This is kind of the pet shop where the animals are kept,

803
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:28,120
and the animals have different behavior when you pick them up.

804
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:31,870
When I pick the cat up, it kind of scrunches up against

805
00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:36,040
the glass and when I drop him, he tumbles.

806
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:39,330
[Hershenson] These really creative people, but they would have these flights of fancy.

807
00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:41,700
I mean, they would just go off in all kinds of crazy directions

808
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:47,330
and they were amazing ideas, but, dudes, we got to ship a product at the end of the day.

809
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:51,450
And during that time, the Newton shipped.

810
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:53,910
[Apple engineer] Ladies and gentleman, Newton is here.

811
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:57,700
[Sculley] Newton was the product that was ready to go.

812
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:00,040
It was all about new technologies.

813
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:03,700
The most important thing that I've ever been involved with in my entire life.

814
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:06,330
[Hershenson] It's bad enough you get betrayed by them, but now

815
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:09,660
they're gonna try to put you out of business.

816
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:13,370
[ominous music]

817
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:18,750
[Marc] There was always something else to be tuned up,

818
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:20,370
there was some bug to be caught,

819
00:53:20,370 --> 00:53:22,290
there was some memory leak to be plugged up

820
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:25,290
and the date got later and later and later.

821
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,700
I'd made commitments.

822
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:29,290
The company had made commitments,

823
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:31,580
and the commitments were now being undone

824
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:35,660
by our inability, or maybe even cultural unwillingness

825
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:38,160
to let something out the door that wasn't like perfect.

826
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:43,250
And I felt the first wave, that first zap of terror.

827
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:46,660
We were too dazzled by what it could possibly do

828
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:51,620
to kind of realize we were biting off more than we could chew.

829
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:56,200
I was still in creative mode, working on a flipping coin,

830
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,410
uh, so the game room would have something in it.

831
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:02,500
Whereas you tap the coin and it would flip around heads or tails

832
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:05,410
and gave you a random number for feedback and all.

833
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:09,410
And I was setting a bad example for the team by doing stuff

834
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:13,250
that was relatively frivolous when we needed

835
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:18,910
to concentrate on the boring, uh, but necessary parts.

836
00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:24,410
And it really made me do some soul searching that I was kind of, uh...

837
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:27,580
leading people astray and not having

838
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:31,790
quite the right, uh, seriousness of our situation.

839
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:36,000
[Adler] The deadline is everything, meet this date or miss your opportunity

840
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,450
to change the world.

841
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:39,160
I don't think we had anyone saying that.

842
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:44,080
I was like, "Huh... OK, I'm not crazy,

843
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:47,450
I love all the people I work with, but something ain't right."

844
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:53,120
My heroes, these icons, that I know as people now,

845
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,830
how are they letting this happen?

846
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:57,450
Don't they see? Don't--

847
00:54:57,450 --> 00:54:59,540
Aren't they listening? Kind of like parents, right?

848
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:02,790
At some point when you grow up, your parents can do no wrong,

849
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:05,580
and then they can only do wrong. It was kind of that same thing.

850
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:09,330
I grew up as a person, and these people who I saw

851
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:13,040
as parents and as educators started to become

852
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:17,620
you know, humans as well in my eye, not just icons.

853
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:21,660
And that's when it kind of flipped for me like, "I can't just follow

854
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:25,500
the leader anymore. You need to be a leader yourself."

855
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:39,910
[Marc] One night, Sunday I think, and I walk into the building and I hear

856
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:44,120
slam, slam, bang, bang, bang. No idea what was going on, no idea.

857
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:47,540
And just banging away building what looked to me like bunk beds.

858
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:50,870
I said, "Guys, what, what are you doing here?" They said, "We're building bunk beds."

859
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:55,870
Why do you need to build a bunk bed in your office? Why don't you go home to sleep?

860
00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:58,660
[Tony] We had to go up against it, pull it together to get

861
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:02,330
something out the door. We've got to get serious.

862
00:56:02,330 --> 00:56:04,580
[Megan] I remember like sleeping on, you know, some random

863
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:07,250
mattress on the floor, we didn't care about all this,

864
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:10,370
we didn't care whether we had furniture or anything, we were just doing this thing.

865
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:13,870
[Kevin] So we're just working all out all the time, uh, and I-- I was actually sleeping

866
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:17,870
under my desk sometimes and then I would get up in the morning and just start working again.

867
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:22,080
[Stern] It's night time, people are clustered around a handful of machines.

868
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:25,580
The rabbits are running around under their feet, the parrot is squawking

869
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:27,790
and shitting all the time. It smelled horrible.

870
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:34,790
[chuckles] Uh, it-- it was dank, musty, you know it smelt of sweat

871
00:56:34,790 --> 00:56:40,750
and exhaustion and no one wanted to be anywhere else.

872
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:43,910
We'll have it, we'll have it tomorrow morning, alright? So--

873
00:56:43,910 --> 00:56:47,540
[Stern] Every single one of us, it was all hands on deck, ship or die.

874
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:49,700
[Hershenson] There was this constant drum beat of,

875
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:53,250
"We have to ship, we have to ship, we have to ship."

876
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:56,250
[Stern] In terms of intensity and pressure it was the best of times

877
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:59,950
and it was the worst of times. In some ways we were never closer to each other

878
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:04,790
and we never felt better about what we were doing, because we were getting there.

879
00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:07,250
-[woman] My fingers? -[engineer] Uh-huh. Both hands.

880
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:10,370
-[woman] That'll never work. -[engineer] One finger at the other end.

881
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:12,790
-[keyboard clicking] -[woman laughing]

882
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:15,910
[man] It's quick, it's-- there's a pleasing pace to it.

883
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:18,620
-[engineer] A little better? OK. -[man 4] Yeah, much better, much better.

884
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:21,160
[Megan] It's this incredible experience

885
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:24,910
of sort of all these different people working, you know, like a symphony.

886
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:28,450
[Tony] This thing that we imagined, now has become real.

887
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:32,750
[Hershenson] We've done it, and now you can see it and touch it and use it as well.

888
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:36,790
[Tony] It's time to ship. We need to get this out.

889
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:39,620
[Adler] It was one in the morning, everyone was there,

890
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:41,160
everyone was exhausted.

891
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:42,700
It was a classic decision

892
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:45,290
that every project has to make like, go or no go.

893
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:50,660
So here we all were, in it together and saying like, "Is this it, are we done?"

894
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:53,700
[Hershenson] Marc Porat said, "Anyone could speak about whether we should ship.

895
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:58,540
Is the software ready?" And a ton of engineers said, "We should wait."

896
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:03,540
Marc listened and he said, "Our partners have given us a deadline, we're shipping."

897
00:58:10,910 --> 00:58:15,000
So welcome to the first public demonstration of-- of General Magic's technologies.

898
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,290
I wanna talk a little bit about, um, you know, we worked really hard the last four years

899
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:23,700
putting all this stuff together. Uh, I feel, you know, emotional about it.

900
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:27,660
-Uh, people, uh, people-- -[audience applauding]

901
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:31,910
-What I wanna do is, uh, is talk about the, uh-- -[audience applauding]

902
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:35,870
The incredible-- the best part of working on this the last four years is not the invention,

903
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:39,500
I-- I love helping create this stuff, but the best part was working

904
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,790
with the incredible team that we have assembled at General Magic.

905
00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:46,120
This isn't the work of just me and Bill, but the work of some incredibly brilliant,

906
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:50,250
passionate people that I'm honored to be able to work with and I think these guys

907
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:53,290
these-- We're working with a bunch of young programmers in their twenties

908
00:58:53,290 --> 00:58:57,660
that are going to go on to do things that dwarf anything that Bill and I have ever done.

909
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:04,000
They are just incredibly great and so, without further ado, with, uh, great pride, uh,

910
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,450
and representing Bill and-- and the amazing team at General Magic,

911
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:10,250
here it is world, Magic Cap.

912
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:13,620
-[SONY commercial] It's a new way to reach just about anyone -[beeping]

913
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:16,700
-...anywhere, anytime. -[beeping]

914
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:18,870
You're only a press of a button away.

915
00:59:18,870 --> 00:59:22,830
-[beeping] -Sony Magic Link, and what it takes off your desk

916
00:59:22,830 --> 00:59:26,580
is only matched, by what it takes off your mind.

917
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:32,660
Sony Magic Link Intelligent Communicator. It clears your desk, it clears your mind."

918
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:35,410
[Kevin] Still so very disturbing when you, when you work on something for so long

919
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:38,290
and then you let it out into the world. It's like having this baby

920
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:42,080
and like, have you raised it well enough? Is it going to be okay on its own out there?

921
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:45,250
Uhm, it's a little traumatic, actually to let something out like that.

922
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:50,200
[audience cheering, clapping]

923
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:58,790
Hey, these really belong to you, somebody asked me that. They are yours!

924
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:01,410
-[laughter] -[audience applauding]

925
01:00:01,410 --> 01:00:05,950
[Marc] Whatever doubts we had or whatever disagreements or anything, we were on.

926
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:09,410
We were, this was the moment, this was the launch.

927
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:12,700
We were gonna make it, we were gonna succeed and it was gonna be amazing.

928
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:22,200
[Marc] So, what are we doing? Today we are making the first steps.

929
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:26,790
This afternoon it's out there, the devices are out there and the service is out there.

930
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,870
[Stern] We had arranged to have a demonstration day at Fry's,

931
01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:37,080
a famous place for new product introductions.

932
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:40,080
And a few famous people from Apple came, just out of courtesy.

933
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:43,700
We went into the store and all of the, all of the demonstration stuff was way in the back,

934
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:48,080
behind the refrigerators, you couldn't see anything. It became clear that the Fry's staff

935
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:51,830
had not been trained on how to demonstrate the devices, or even knew

936
01:00:51,830 --> 01:00:55,700
what they were or who we were, or why we were there.

937
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:59,580
[Amy] We talked about our user as being Joe Sixpack.

938
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:05,450
And I do remember sitting around thinking, "You know, Joe Sixpack really doesn't have email."

939
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:09,620
And if that was our target, it was very early for-- for Joe Sixpack.

940
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:12,250
[MacAskill] I worried about the size, I worried about the battery life,

941
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:13,910
I worried about the 800 dollars.

942
01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:15,660
I don't even know which button to push.

943
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:18,450
No, I don't need that. [laughter]

944
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:19,950
-[reporter] You might need it. -I don't.

945
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:22,910
What it really comes down to is a personal decision

946
01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:25,750
as to whether or not you really wanna be in touch all the time.

947
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:35,750
[Stern] My stomach turned sour and I thought we're doomed.

948
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:42,080
No one came, no one bought it. Nothing.

949
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:47,370
[Marc] And so we are waiting for the sales to happen and the sales numbers were low.

950
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:51,620
Very low, and there were some problems with the AT&T Network. So bit by bit

951
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:54,750
we began to get evidence that this thing wasn't gonna rocket right,

952
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:59,830
it was gonna be more difficult, and that's the reality that starts to sink in,

953
01:01:59,830 --> 01:02:01,950
is that, this is not as easy as it seems.

954
01:02:01,950 --> 01:02:05,370
We had sold fewer than 3000 devices, and almost all of those

955
01:02:05,370 --> 01:02:08,830
had been sold to friends and family of the company and our partners.

956
01:02:08,830 --> 01:02:12,080
Virtually none to ordinary consumers.

957
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:15,370
I was looking at the list of the names of the buyers

958
01:02:15,370 --> 01:02:19,450
and I recognized all of them, I knew who they were, and I thought

959
01:02:19,450 --> 01:02:23,910
that we don't have a business here, we are not gonna make it.

960
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:36,660
[Marc] Share price, that's I think, the greatest concern in this room and that's

961
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:38,620
what we're going to take on, head on.

962
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:42,040
The explosion of the Internet has forced a rethinking of strategies

963
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:43,500
across the entire industry.

964
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,950
I have believed for years, and continue to believe,

965
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:50,160
that the notion of taking intelligent devices with you,

966
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:53,790
of the scale from this big

967
01:02:53,790 --> 01:02:56,950
to that small is for real as a market.

968
01:02:56,950 --> 01:02:59,120
I continue to believe in the wireless dimension,

969
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:02,120
there will be smart phones, there will be smart pagers,

970
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:04,910
and maybe even things like intelligent watches, for all we know.

971
01:03:04,910 --> 01:03:10,160
It's a question of resources, priorities and market readiness,

972
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:12,370
uh, for us to figure out where the sweet spot is. We--

973
01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:15,660
-[Heckler] Can we make some money while this is going on? -[Marc chuckles]

974
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:18,500
[Hershenson] This guy from the San Francisco Chronicle, I mean, I remember

975
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,660
he just drilled me. He was like,

976
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:23,580
"You guys are going out of business.

977
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:29,120
Sony is going to drop you. I have sources that have told me that.

978
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:31,830
What is the company's response?

979
01:03:31,830 --> 01:03:35,250
What happens when Sony drops you?

980
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:38,540
You guys are dead."

981
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:41,000
It's like, dude, you didn't work here for three and a half years,

982
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
pulling all-nighters, seven days a week.

983
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,200
You didn't see the future and know what's coming

984
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:50,000
and, and now it's all just in ashes around you.

985
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,500
[Stern] I'm looking at spreadsheets, in my office

986
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:56,790
and thinking, "In a half hour I'm gonna have to get on the phone

987
01:03:56,790 --> 01:04:01,040
and talk to the analyst from Goldman Sachs and I don't know what the hell I'm gonna say.

988
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:04,040
How do I create the impression that there is a future here."

989
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:06,370
Marc did it, but, uh, I was at a loss.

990
01:04:06,370 --> 01:04:11,000
The initial experience is terrific, and where we are headed

991
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,950
is sublime, and to get from terrific to sublime takes time.

992
01:04:14,950 --> 01:04:17,870
-[Hoffman] I don't want to be negative. -Why is this tilted?

993
01:04:17,870 --> 01:04:20,450
-[cameraman] It's not titled. -[Hoffman] It's been a lot of hype.

994
01:04:20,450 --> 01:04:24,250
I would not say that in the video. Where we are starting, as exciting as it is,

995
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:26,540
is not where we are going to end up. This will take time.

996
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:30,450
It's a voyage that takes time, it's a journey that takes time. This will take time.

997
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:33,000
It takes time. You have to be patient.

998
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,500
[Hoffman] Perfect, absolutely perfect.

999
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,200
You know, I just thought as you were talking

1000
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:38,000
how complicated it is for you to be figuring out

1001
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
-what you can and can't say. -Yeah, it's true. [chuckles]

1002
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,540
It's a whole other issue I wasn't thinking about.

1003
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:46,040
[Hoffman indistinct]

1004
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:48,500
I was torn up, it was...

1005
01:04:51,410 --> 01:04:55,500
To walk in, there was a week, you know, Phil actually had to set me aside

1006
01:04:55,500 --> 01:05:01,160
because I was so distraught, that there was a week or two that I actually just took off.

1007
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:03,910
I didn't even show up for work because I was so distraught.

1008
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:08,080
And then Phil actually had to sit me down and go, "Tony what's wrong? You're not you."

1009
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:14,250
Like to go from 80, 120 hours a week to none.

1010
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:18,330
And so for me personally that was a major rocking event.

1011
01:05:18,330 --> 01:05:23,290
Then the next one disappointment for me is, you know, I started design devices

1012
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:26,950
and I started to try to mold General Magic technology

1013
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:30,620
into something that I thought was sellable.

1014
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:34,250
And so I created basically a whole product plan, and technology plan

1015
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:36,870
for what I thought was going to be a successful product.

1016
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:39,950
I go back to General Magic, I said, "Look I have a firmed up product plan,

1017
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:43,540
you need to mold your software to build this kind of device." And they just looked at me

1018
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:48,540
and said, "Sorry, we can't do that. We have other priorities."

1019
01:05:51,330 --> 01:05:57,290
For General Magic, as I saw it, was, basically the end.

1020
01:05:57,290 --> 01:06:01,450
They were defeated. That was the saddest part about that meeting,

1021
01:06:01,450 --> 01:06:06,000
is that, and Andy in particular I think was the one who said,

1022
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:11,410
"We're not gonna-- we can't do this. We're not going to do it," and...

1023
01:06:11,410 --> 01:06:13,700
they just didn't-- They didn't have anything left.

1024
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:19,580
[Kevin] I am a particularly loyal person, so it was, it was

1025
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:21,540
very hard for me to leave General Magic.

1026
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:24,330
I was fully bought into what we were doing, uhm,

1027
01:06:24,330 --> 01:06:28,700
and I stayed perhaps even longer than maybe I ought to have, to try to help

1028
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:31,200
change the direction, uhm,

1029
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:35,080
but it was, it was beyond, uhm, saving, unfortunately.

1030
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:39,750
[Stern] 看起来就像一个巨大的灾难 It looked like a massive disaster,

1031
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:42,330
一次失败、一个悲剧 a failure, a catastrophe.

1032
01:06:42,330 --> 01:06:45,830
It was a sense of rejection that penetrated right to your heart

1033
01:06:45,830 --> 01:06:49,200
and your gut, and I-- I just felt sick.

1034
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:12,500
[Joanna] It was, uh, devastating. For me it was, it was really devastating

1035
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:17,040
and, uh, I thought immediately, "I have to take time off.

1036
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:22,200
It's-- it's going to be a long time before I start committing

1037
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:28,750
to yet another blue sky, uh, proposition."

1038
01:07:30,410 --> 01:07:34,040
[Stern] Marc、Bill 和 Andy 向全世界 The vision that Marc, Bill and Andy had sold,

1039
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:37,580
向我们自己灌输了这个想法 not just to the world, but to us,

1040
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:41,160
这东西很酷、很有趣 that this was a cool, fun,

1041
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:45,750
每个人都会想要一个，因为感觉我们自己就很想要 lovely thing to have, and that everybody would want one because we did.

1042
01:07:46,790 --> 01:07:48,250
但我们错了 And we were wrong.

1043
01:07:57,290 --> 01:08:00,910
[whimsical music]

1044
01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:13,620
[Swisher] 我觉得这个概念是有了，单用户基础不存在 I think the conceptual ideas were there, the user base was not there,

1045
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:17,620
我们需要的技术也并不存在 the technology was not there, the things to do on it were not there,

1046
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:20,160
就想要在 1880 年代发明电视机，这完全不可能 it's like inventing the television in the 1880's, you just couldn't.

1047
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:23,620
Like it doesn't matter if you invented it because you didn't have shows,

1048
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:25,790
you didn't have capabilities.

1049
01:08:25,790 --> 01:08:29,160
I think there was actually nothing General Magic could have done

1050
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:32,870
to succeed, because they were at the wrong time.

1051
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:38,330
The way I think about that, it's like a wave. If you start paddling too early

1052
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:41,000
your arms will be tired by the time the wave arrives,

1053
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,910
and the wave will slide right under you and leave you behind.

1054
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:47,790
That's sort of what happened with General Magic. They saw the wave before anyone else,

1055
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:52,290
and they thought it was coming sooner and they got tired before it arrived.

1056
01:08:52,290 --> 01:08:54,870
Yeah, but they had all the right talent.

1057
01:08:57,330 --> 01:09:00,080
[Sculley] You can become so focused, and such a believer

1058
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:04,660
in what you are doing that you can miss the change of context in an industry.

1059
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:09,830
In this case, the World Wide Web and General Magic probably didn't pivot,

1060
01:09:09,830 --> 01:09:15,370
uh, fast enough to the post world after the Web, but I missed it as well.

1061
01:09:15,370 --> 01:09:17,910
I was getting increased pressure as a CEO of Apple,

1062
01:09:17,910 --> 01:09:22,500
by the Apple board, you know, why was I wasting Apple's time and money

1063
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:26,160
on these post PC devices and not just focusing on the Macintosh.

1064
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:28,830
The result? I eventually got fired by Apple.

1065
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:41,700
I learned from failure how incredibly painful it can be when you fail publicly.

1066
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:44,330
It wasn't just the little failures, but, you know, I had to fail

1067
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:47,540
in front of the whole world when I was fired from Apple.

1068
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:51,160
It really hurt me for a long, long time, and it wasn't

1069
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:55,700
till about 15 years later that I could actually get my head around and deal with it.

1070
01:10:01,370 --> 01:10:04,370
But the stories of Silicon Valley are always the stories

1071
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:08,290
of these incredibly successful companies,

1072
01:10:08,290 --> 01:10:11,540
and yet here is a company, General Magic,

1073
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:15,950
that wasn't commercially successful and eventually went bankrupt,

1074
01:10:15,950 --> 01:10:20,580
and yet so much of what came out of General Magic

1075
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:24,330
is the foundation of everything we take for granted today.

1076
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:39,250
[Joanna] Failure doesn't-- doesn't stop me as long as it's

1077
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:42,580
on a path towards something really wonderful.

1078
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:47,120
But with General Magic there was a certain deflation in me personally,

1079
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:52,330
where I felt like, uh, "Will I be able to do this one more time? I'm not sure."

1080
01:10:52,330 --> 01:10:57,700
Because the potential was so phenomenal and you could see this is going to happen.

1081
01:10:57,700 --> 01:11:01,500
You know that this is going to happen, and you realize

1082
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:04,540
you're not gonna be the one that makes it happen.

1083
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:08,620
It's even more comprehensive than I remembered.

1084
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:10,790
Yeah.

1085
01:11:10,790 --> 01:11:16,910
[chuckles] Now that I look at it, I think, what were we thinking?

1086
01:11:16,910 --> 01:11:19,540
We were trying to do all this?

1087
01:11:19,540 --> 01:11:21,620
And, you know...

1088
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:25,200
And we thought we could push the industry, we could make them do it.

1089
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:30,950
Mm... Not there, it wasn't there.

1090
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:35,370
[emotional music]

1091
01:11:45,910 --> 01:11:51,120
I'm old enough now to know that it's behind me, you know, it's-- it's, uh--

1092
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:53,750
To create technical revolution

1093
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:58,290
is-- is really a game for people in their, in their twenties.

1094
01:11:58,290 --> 01:12:02,500
The stamina, you're also not as contaminated by the past.

1095
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:14,540
More than anything else it makes me feel old.

1096
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:19,540
[chuckles] That, uh, stuff I-- I worked on

1097
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:24,080
or bought, you know, is-- are-- they are now museum pieces.

1098
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:32,910
Yeah, so there is a General Magic device, the Sony Magic Link.

1099
01:12:36,950 --> 01:12:40,410
Now I have thought about it a lot, there is a whole litany of things,

1100
01:12:40,410 --> 01:12:42,700
uh, we should have done differently.

1101
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:47,410
A lot of blunders that I'm personally responsible for.

1102
01:12:47,410 --> 01:12:51,370
It was completely possible to achieve the most ambitious

1103
01:12:51,370 --> 01:12:54,910
of our visions, uh, but in a staged fashion.

1104
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:05,750
[Marc] We sometimes need closure on things that are not closeable.

1105
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:11,080
A peak experience, positive or negative happens, it's not easy to resolve.

1106
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:17,620
In the moment we all do the best we can do in the moment, at that moment.

1107
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:20,620
It's in retrospect that you see what the impact was.

1108
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:26,450
I felt, a profound feeling of humiliation.

1109
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:33,910
Shame that I had brought everyone along with such high anticipation

1110
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:37,200
and then couldn't at the end, deliver it for them,

1111
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:39,450
and for myself, and for them.

1112
01:13:44,790 --> 01:13:51,750
So I remember coming home one evening, so the kids were still up.

1113
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:58,120
"Daddy." And daddy had given it all to perfect strangers.

1114
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:01,950
[mother speaking indistinct]

1115
01:14:01,950 --> 01:14:07,540
And my wife said, "Don't come home like this."

1116
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:09,500
[filmmaker] Can you, Marc slide over to your right,

1117
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:11,500
so you are not bracketing the plate.

1118
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:16,950
[Marc] "If you need to sit in your car, for hours

1119
01:14:16,950 --> 01:14:20,620
or for all night, don't come back.

1120
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:24,500
Don't walk in the door if you're not a person, if you're not present,

1121
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:27,660
because, you're not wanted."

1122
01:14:32,410 --> 01:14:35,700
And you know in-- in-- it collapsed,

1123
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:42,620
it all came tumbling down, and the company didn't work, and my marriage didn't work,

1124
01:14:42,620 --> 01:14:45,080
in the same 12 month period, you know.

1125
01:14:46,790 --> 01:14:48,660
And it all fell apart.

1126
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:53,290
Yeah.

1127
01:14:53,290 --> 01:14:56,660
[melancholic music]

1128
01:15:00,870 --> 01:15:03,660
[interviewer] Have you told your children about this?

1129
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:06,580
Well I'm talking to them now, aren't I? [chuckles]

1130
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:08,750
It's one of the reasons I agreed to make this film.

1131
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,950
Life is ebbs and flows, when a wave crashes on the shores

1132
01:15:19,950 --> 01:15:24,450
and the rocks hear, you don't think of the wave as having failed.

1133
01:15:24,450 --> 01:15:29,790
You think of the wave as having done its thing and the next wave will come and the next wave,

1134
01:15:29,790 --> 01:15:33,250
and that's how I think of General Magic. A moment in time.

1135
01:15:38,540 --> 01:15:43,290
[Sculley] It always amazed me, because I haven't seen Marc in many, many years,

1136
01:15:43,290 --> 01:15:47,330
you know, why there wasn't a second act.

1137
01:15:47,330 --> 01:15:51,040
Because here is an individual who was so good,

1138
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:53,700
so exceptional at what he did well.

1139
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:56,910
Brought together perhaps the best team

1140
01:15:56,910 --> 01:15:58,910
and the reality is, in my mind Marc never failed,

1141
01:15:58,910 --> 01:16:03,700
you know, because he actually did conceptualize

1142
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:07,160
so many of the products that we have today.

1143
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:18,000
It was a decade of failure in Silicon Valley for me.

1144
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:23,580
General Magic was a disaster, Phillips was a critical success, but a business disaster.

1145
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:28,160
Then I had my start up and then, you know, during the start up times the Internet crunch

1146
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:31,330
happened and I couldn't get any more funding and that was a disaster.

1147
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:35,620
So it was a disaster after disaster from a business perspective.

1148
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:39,790
But from a personal perspective it caused me to grow up each time,

1149
01:16:39,790 --> 01:16:44,410
and learn because I was faced with this real reality

1150
01:16:44,410 --> 01:16:49,950
of like, this isn't working and you better understand why and learn from it.

1151
01:16:49,950 --> 01:16:53,620
Because I had to go through that to be able to set my-- to set the stage up

1152
01:16:53,620 --> 01:16:56,370
for what was to come in 2001 and beyond.

1153
01:16:59,950 --> 01:17:04,870
[lively electronic music]

1154
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:14,620
[Tony] General Magic gave us a glimpse of what the future could be.

1155
01:17:14,620 --> 01:17:17,660
The technology unfortunately wasn't there at the time,

1156
01:17:17,660 --> 01:17:20,830
but those dreams, we kept dreaming.

1157
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:29,040
[Dee] Tony is very big on music and he would talk about music a lot and how,

1158
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:33,000
how someday we were gonna have, you know, a little device

1159
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:39,700
with all our music on it and I'm like, "OK, why do I need that?"

1160
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:42,870
[Tony] I loved music growing up in Detroit, and I was always sick

1161
01:17:42,870 --> 01:17:46,120
and tired of lugging my CD's and all this other stuff around.

1162
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:48,700
I wanted something where I could take it all the time.

1163
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:52,540
MP3 showed up. I was like, music is coming.

1164
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:58,080
Next thing I know I get a call, "We've looked at all the MP3 players, we think they are bad.

1165
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:00,750
We think there is one that can be done in the Apple way."

1166
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:05,410
And then Steve said, "Now we need you to come on the team to put it together."

1167
01:18:05,410 --> 01:18:08,040
And then I started calling all kinds of companies

1168
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:11,250
all around the valley, around world. Trying to figure out displays

1169
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:13,580
trying to figure out batteries, trying to figure out storage

1170
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:17,040
and then Steve was able, and the team was able to build on top of those

1171
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:20,870
and make it even better, and so we were like, it's happening.

1172
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:23,000
[Steve Jobs] Boom, that's iPod. I happen to have one right here

1173
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,040
in my pocket, as a matter of fact. There it is, right there.

1174
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:29,830
[Tony] The Magic lesson was, we have to ship it as fast as possible

1175
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:33,080
so you could learn from the market and you can iterate quickly.

1176
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:35,910
Every year we made sure we had a new version of the iPod.

1177
01:18:35,910 --> 01:18:38,290
And then we added downloadable apps,

1178
01:18:38,290 --> 01:18:41,870
games, email, communications, wireless.

1179
01:18:41,870 --> 01:18:45,540
We had these different pieces and I'm like this is starting to come together.

1180
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:49,580
I remember this, and it was like I was back at General Magic

1181
01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:56,080
again in a way, because it's what we talked about, just 15 years later.

1182
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:59,120
This is real, Steve goes,

1183
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:02,910
"It's taking off, we need to put it on a cellphone."

1184
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:11,290
[Steve Jobs] Today Apple is going to reinvent the phone.

1185
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:15,540
And here it is. This is one device.

1186
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:22,040
This has been, at that point, 17 years in Silicon Valley,

1187
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:24,790
and we were finally able to realize the dream we had

1188
01:19:24,790 --> 01:19:29,000
in 1991 on stage and Steve Jobs talking about it.

1189
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,250
We're going to use the best pointing device in the world.

1190
01:19:31,250 --> 01:19:34,250
We're going to use a pointing device that we are all born with,

1191
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:37,910
we're born with ten of them, we are going to use our fingers.

1192
01:19:37,910 --> 01:19:42,830
So, let's go ahead and turn it on, alrighty.

1193
01:19:42,830 --> 01:19:47,200
[Stern] I was proud to think that, "Yeah, my god, we did it."

1194
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:51,950
Tony did it. Everything we wanted to do, there it is.

1195
01:19:51,950 --> 01:19:55,830
and on the other hand, I was sad that it wasn't us.

1196
01:19:55,830 --> 01:19:59,870
But I also felt vindicated in some way.

1197
01:19:59,870 --> 01:20:03,080
That the ideas had been right, the timing had been wrong.

1198
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:09,750
[Andy] Steve would often call me after like the big product introductions,

1199
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:15,160
just to see what I thought. 4:00 p.m. I was in my office, I got a call from Steve.

1200
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:17,330
He said, "What do you think, what do you think?"

1201
01:20:17,330 --> 01:20:22,000
And it was like the worst cell phone connection I've ever heard.

1202
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:27,330
You know it was all like, you could hear Steve, say:

1203
01:20:27,330 --> 01:20:32,120
So the first thing I ask him, I said, "Are you talking on an iPhone?"

1204
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:35,200
He goes, "No, no, no." But I think he was.

1205
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:38,830
Steve told me on the phone, he thought a lot about Magic Cap

1206
01:20:38,830 --> 01:20:41,370
during the course of the iPhone development,

1207
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:46,040
and in particular mentioned the projected keyboard, he had seen that

1208
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:48,790
and used it with Magic Cap and that gave him faith

1209
01:20:48,790 --> 01:20:51,870
that, that was the right direction to go.

1210
01:20:51,870 --> 01:20:54,120
-Hey Zarko. -Hi, Andy.

1211
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:56,870
Hi, I'm in the middle of giving a demo of Magic Cap for cellphones.

1212
01:20:56,870 --> 01:20:59,330
It's really exciting, it's working great.

1213
01:20:59,330 --> 01:21:01,500
-You guys-- You guys did a great job. -It's incredible.

1214
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:04,370
Yeah, yeah it's almost like you are in the next room or something.

1215
01:21:04,370 --> 01:21:08,290
-Yeah, amazing. Bye. -Yeah, OK.

1216
01:21:08,290 --> 01:21:13,700
[Joanna] Had I thought that it would be done by Steve Jobs,

1217
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:19,540
if I had known that then, I think I wouldn't have been as devastated.

1218
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:24,160
Because then I would know that it would be done and it would be done right.

1219
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:26,950
It was very gratifying, because it had come full circle, you know?

1220
01:21:26,950 --> 01:21:31,120
Started with the Mac, and had spawned General Magic.

1221
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:36,580
General Magic progeny had spawned iPhone and Android.

1222
01:21:36,580 --> 01:21:39,160
I mean, we can't forget the Android.

1223
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:41,580
Thank you for joining us today. You know Android

1224
01:21:41,580 --> 01:21:43,120
obviously, you know, being an open source project,

1225
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:46,290
we consider ourselves the shepherd of it.

1226
01:21:46,290 --> 01:21:48,750
So you see the vision continues.

1227
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:52,870
You know, if you look at Android, Andy Rubin droid, Andy was right there

1228
01:21:52,870 --> 01:21:57,080
with us and then he carried it to Android and he makes it to now where we are.

1229
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:59,450
I mean, here's the test, what if General Magic

1230
01:21:59,450 --> 01:22:02,910
never happened, would we have had Android?

1231
01:22:02,910 --> 01:22:06,450
Not a chance, I mean all these things were linked together, one after another.

1232
01:22:06,450 --> 01:22:09,620
[Andy] One out of every five people on the planet uses

1233
01:22:09,620 --> 01:22:12,910
an Android phone, uh, growing every month.

1234
01:22:12,910 --> 01:22:17,450
[Markoff] The vision was true, the vision was accurate, the vision is the idea

1235
01:22:17,450 --> 01:22:21,580
that basically got computing to the last hurdle.

1236
01:22:21,580 --> 01:22:23,700
The last hurdle was when computing got into

1237
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:25,540
the palm of the hand of everybody in the world.

1238
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:31,620
And between Tony and-- and Andy, that's about 98%

1239
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:37,040
of the world's smartphones, is those two guys who sat 15 feet apart.

1240
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:40,700
That's pretty amazing, and that by itself is--

1241
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:46,910
brings such satisfaction. It's, uh-- I can't even describe it.

1242
01:22:46,910 --> 01:22:49,870
[Andy] First obvious thing to mention is that we are not alone here today.

1243
01:22:49,870 --> 01:22:55,330
We are being filmed for posterity as part of our-- our introduction video.

1244
01:22:55,330 --> 01:22:58,080
Who knows if any of this will really be in the video.

1245
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:01,620
[Amy] Imagine a star that went supernova

1246
01:23:01,620 --> 01:23:06,160
and everything that you touch today,

1247
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:09,120
everything you interact with today technology wise

1248
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:12,160
is because that star power touched it.

1249
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:14,160
I mean, all these companies, and I don't know

1250
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:17,040
if you add up the value of those what it would be,

1251
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:20,330
but they all had their genesis with this crew

1252
01:23:20,330 --> 01:23:24,290
of just a few dozen people, who were at General Magic.

1253
01:23:24,290 --> 01:23:26,950
[Adler] It was one of the only times I've ever felt like

1254
01:23:26,950 --> 01:23:29,250
there's no weak link in this chain,

1255
01:23:29,250 --> 01:23:30,750
everyone on this team,

1256
01:23:30,750 --> 01:23:33,750
uh, is brilliant, is so committed and passionate.

1257
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:37,080
What's so rare is having all those things at the same time.

1258
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:39,450
[Tony] When you look at that class of people

1259
01:23:39,450 --> 01:23:44,120
and what the world looks like today, that was the training ground

1260
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:48,500
for us, for what has shaped the world of today.

1261
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:51,450
[Kevin] We all carry things from General Magic, in terms of our view

1262
01:23:51,450 --> 01:23:53,120
of what could be possible in the future.

1263
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:56,080
And as engineers you can't help but think,

1264
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:59,830
"There's-- there's-- Can we do this now? How about now?"

1265
01:23:59,830 --> 01:24:04,870
I am so, so excited to show you our work, and I'm wearing Apple Watch right here.

1266
01:24:04,870 --> 01:24:08,410
A lot of General Magic was imagining what the world would be like if some things existed

1267
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:11,250
that maybe we would make, and that's so fun to do.

1268
01:24:11,250 --> 01:24:13,290
You can control both the eyes and the mouth to get just

1269
01:24:13,290 --> 01:24:15,830
the right expression you would like to send to somebody.

1270
01:24:15,830 --> 01:24:19,080
And that is so true in so many fields right now, you are able to actually

1271
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:23,000
transform industries by your work in technology.

1272
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,120
[Tony] When you look at someone like Megan taking all of her knowledge

1273
01:24:27,450 --> 01:24:29,120
and all the things she learned,

1274
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:31,200
and now bringing it to the government and seeing

1275
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:34,330
how the US Government is transforming through that.

1276
01:24:34,330 --> 01:24:38,410
Hello, everybody, how you doing?

1277
01:24:38,410 --> 01:24:40,830
-Good to see you, is this my seat right here ? -Yes, it is.

1278
01:24:40,830 --> 01:24:44,620
President Obama had created the US Chief Technology Officer, which is my job

1279
01:24:44,620 --> 01:24:48,120
and our team and really said: "Come and help me using those new methods

1280
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:51,830
on some of these harder problems, these problems that are in our civic space."

1281
01:24:51,830 --> 01:24:53,790
There is the future right here.

1282
01:24:53,790 --> 01:24:55,450
One of the things that I like to work on is

1283
01:24:55,450 --> 01:24:59,290
how to use technology to make people's lives better

1284
01:24:59,290 --> 01:25:02,080
and sort of harness talent and unlock talent.

1285
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:06,790
I love thinking about, uh, how magic is anywhere.

1286
01:25:06,790 --> 01:25:11,080
Uh, in everyone, and how do you pull that out

1287
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:16,790
and really make sure that the talent that wants to do its thing is able to do it.

1288
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:25,700
[Swisher] You know, as the human race thrives really on this planet

1289
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:29,950
it creates all kinds of problems, education, uniting people, climate change.

1290
01:25:29,950 --> 01:25:34,040
There is not enough water, there is not enough food. What are we going to do?

1291
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:38,660
Those can all be solved with technologies, it's just a question how humanity uses it.

1292
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:46,500
But, the reliance on technology for everything, for human interactions is worrisome.

1293
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:49,620
Where people are, you know, you go to anything and everyone is like this, right.

1294
01:25:49,620 --> 01:25:53,160
Um, so I worry about what happens to society and children

1295
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:55,660
and how they interact with each other.

1296
01:25:58,370 --> 01:26:01,200
You can't change the human race, yeah, but you can start

1297
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:03,450
to educate them so that they change their behaviors.

1298
01:26:03,450 --> 01:26:06,580
And so the question is, can you take these powerful tools

1299
01:26:06,580 --> 01:26:10,200
and do something that really does help a lot of people?

1300
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:13,370
Can you inspire a group of young people now, to really,

1301
01:26:13,370 --> 01:26:17,250
to be creative and come up with these new ideas?

1302
01:26:22,370 --> 01:26:26,330
Tonight, we feature an iconic inventor of iPod and iPhone,

1303
01:26:26,330 --> 01:26:28,540
I would like to bring up five numbers to introduce him.

1304
01:26:28,540 --> 01:26:31,660
Seven billion, two hundred and seventy nine million,

1305
01:26:31,660 --> 01:26:35,370
three hundred and ninety five thousand, eight hundred and seventy three.

1306
01:26:35,370 --> 01:26:39,200
This is the number of kilowatt hours saved by Nest Thermostat owners.

1307
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:43,370
Eighteen, the number of generations of iPod's shipped.

1308
01:26:43,370 --> 01:26:46,540
Three hundred, the number of patents authored.

1309
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:50,370
Three hundred and fifty million, the number of iPods sold.

1310
01:26:50,370 --> 01:26:54,750
Join me in welcoming the one and only Tony Fadell.

1311
01:26:54,750 --> 01:26:58,580
Hi, everybody.

1312
01:26:58,580 --> 01:27:03,040
Let's say, you show up now, you're a kid, you show up here in the Valley,

1313
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:06,580
um, what would you tell someone similar to you who just walked in,

1314
01:27:06,580 --> 01:27:09,410
you know, wet behind the ears in Silicon Valley today?

1315
01:27:09,410 --> 01:27:14,410
You know I am only up here because of many people in this audience,

1316
01:27:14,410 --> 01:27:19,580
who helped me get here, and that's the magic of Silicon Valley.

1317
01:27:19,580 --> 01:27:23,250
We all started in the same place you are in today.

1318
01:27:23,250 --> 01:27:27,200
Everyone has the same self doubts and no one's perfect.

1319
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:30,250
And when you meet your heroes and when you work with them

1320
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:34,250
and they treat you as a peer, learn from it.

1321
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:37,580
Keep moving. If you're dreaming the right dream,

1322
01:27:37,580 --> 01:27:40,700
you're on the right path. I've been there before,

1323
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:42,450
it's tough, keep going.

1324
01:27:44,450 --> 01:27:47,450
These people helped me to become the person I am.

1325
01:27:51,620 --> 01:27:57,790
How can we take this same idea of bold dramatic change

1326
01:27:57,790 --> 01:27:59,910
to help create a better society?

1327
01:27:59,910 --> 01:28:02,200
We are going to have to invent those things

1328
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:08,330
and do it in all of these other domains that are being touched or revolutionized by technology.

1329
01:28:12,290 --> 01:28:16,580
它可能看起来让人畏惧；它可能看起来很难；它可能看起来完全不可能

1330
01:28:16,580 --> 01:28:20,080
but if you just find the right people and keep seeking out

1331
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:24,370
knowledge and advice and keep staying open to make a better world

1332
01:28:24,370 --> 01:28:28,040
regardless of where you come from, great things can happen.

1333
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:30,580
We judge things by the moment in which we feel

1334
01:28:30,580 --> 01:28:33,660
that they have made an impact on the mass culture.

1335
01:28:33,660 --> 01:28:37,290
They are in the anthropology, they are in the culture of how we see

1336
01:28:37,290 --> 01:28:40,290
ourselves, and how we come to expect the world to be

1337
01:28:40,290 --> 01:28:43,620
and I don't think that will happen for another ten years.

1338
01:28:43,620 --> 01:28:46,000
I think we will build to it incrementally and every quarter

1339
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,080
and every year it will get closer and closer,

1340
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:50,870
but I don't think it will be until the 21st century when the stuff

1341
01:28:50,870 --> 01:28:54,540
we are working on today becomes unexceptional, unexceptional.

1342
01:28:54,540 --> 01:28:57,790
Not worth making a video about, and, and that's the test--

1343
01:28:57,790 --> 01:29:01,580
Except for historical documentary purposes. [chuckles]

1344
01:29:01,580 --> 01:29:05,700
And, and that's the test of, uh, of hey, we've made it.

1345
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:06,790
We've really made a difference.

1346
01:29:06,790 --> 01:29:08,540
We've really changed the world.

1347
01:29:08,540 --> 01:29:12,410
[piano music]

1348
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:36,250
[no audible dialogue]
