[舒缓的背景音乐]

2
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:25,083
[Swisher] 在硅谷有很多关于起源的故事

3
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:29,417
这些故事里的公司，有着很正确的理念，但却完完全全

4
00:01:29,417 --> 00:01:34,750
诞生在了错误的时间，然而他们还是推动了所有事情的发展

5
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,125
[Markoff] 有很多故事定义了硅谷

6
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:43,208
世上有很多传奇，而 General Magic 就是其中一个

7
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:48,125
[Sculley] 你必须相信、必须要自豪

8
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:52,458
必须绝对地说服自己

9
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:54,917
你将改变世界运行的轨迹

10
00:01:54,917 --> 00:01:58,125
如果你一直待在安全区，也从未失败

11
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:02,333
那有很大可能就是碌碌无为度过一生

12
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:09,750
[Joanna] 无论我们的梦想多夸张，事实是你能
No matter how big we dreamed, the fact that you could touch

13
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,125
触碰到数以亿计的 the lives of billions, billions,

14
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:13,959
it was vaguely imaginable,

15
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:18,000
but the scale of it was inconceivable.

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,458
[Hershenson] 你为什么要关心 General Magic 的故事？

17
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:25,000
因为这个故事关系到现实世界里很基本的东西
is because it involves something fundamental,

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,667
那就是……失败兵不是一切的结束

19
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:31,875
失败其实是一个开始

20
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,000
[Hoffman] 这个故事至今萦绕在经历者们的心中

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
就是因为他们知道他们当时做的事情是正确的

22
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,917
[Hershenson] 它失败了？或者说，这个公司失败了，但这些想法没有

23
00:02:51,917 --> 00:02:56,375
为这些想法工作的人们没有失败，那……这件事算失败吗？

24
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:05,375
[戏剧性的配乐]

25
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:48,417
[铃声响起]

26
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,000
[Tony] 我当时正在念高中

27
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:27,125
应该是 16 岁吧当时

28
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:31,041
我完全不想上学，在家的日子只要一起床

29
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:35,000
就在电脑前，学习编程和一切跟电脑有关的东西

30
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,375
还跟我朋友讲这些，我是个极客，你知道吗，就是《菜鸟大反攻》里那种

31
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:45,458
从三四岁开始，每个周末我不是在造东西就是在拆东西

32
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:49,125
Soapbox derby racer, or we could repair
lawnmowers or what have you.

33
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:55,166
But with this I could create new things. I could sit there
and I could program a game,

34
00:04:55,166 --> 00:05:00,250
or I could program graphics, I could do things and you spoke
a language no one else knew

35
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,875
and you could tell people about it and they were like, wow.

36
00:05:04,542 --> 00:05:07,834
然后就是 Mac，
And then it was the Mac and it was all about the Mac.

37
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,917
[whispering] What is that?

38
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:19,208
There were names of people like Andy Hertzfeld, Joanna Hoffman,
Bill Atkinson,

39
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:24,375
rock stars in Rolling Stone, but had nothing to do with
music. They were my heroes.

40
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:28,500
我的名字叫 Andy Hertzfeld, 我在 1978 年买了 Apple II 并且爱上了它

41
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:35,250
And went to work for Apple in 1979 and was lucky enough to help design the Macintosh.

42
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,375
You have to go
and find out more about them,

43
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:40,208
and how can I go work with them,
because I wanted to be
like them.

44
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:45,625
[Chariots of Fire
by Vangelis playing]

45
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:48,208
[audience cheering]

46
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:53,834
[computerized voice] Hello,
I am Macintosh. It sure is
great to get out of that bag.

47
00:05:53,834 --> 00:05:55,125
[crowd cheering]

48
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,625
1984 年 1 月 24 日

49
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:00,166
Macintosh 正式公开发布
uh, the Macintosh was being publicly introduced

50
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:03,709
第一次在世人面前揭开面纱
to the world, for the very first time.

51
00:06:03,709 --> 00:06:06,375
[Joanna] You know what I remember? We were sitting here

52
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:13,542
and there was this roar,
just sort of like a sound
wave coming, coming at us.

53
00:06:13,542 --> 00:06:19,417
It was a culmination of years of
work, of years of expectation.

54
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:20,583
This was it.

55
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:24,125
What we are trying to do
with Macintosh is take away

56
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:27,208
yet another barrier
to usage of personal computers.

57
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,625
One of the neatest things
about Macintosh was
we had a chance

58
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:32,500
to change the way that people
thought of computers.

59
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,291
We called it the computer
for the rest of us,

60
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:38,333
because computers
weren't for ordinary people.

61
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:42,458
We thought we had a chance to
make a difference. Steve Jobs
just drummed it into us.

62
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:45,041
He was just such
a brilliant motivator.

63
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:48,083
The greatest people are
self-managing. They don't
need to be managed.

64
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,542
What they need is a common vision.

65
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:53,750
Once they know what to do, they'll go figure out how to do it.

66
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,041
[Andy] We truly believed with every fiber of our being

67
00:06:57,041 --> 00:07:02,458
that if we can solve that problem of, um, making computers accessible

68
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:05,875
to an ordinary person by making them easy enough to use,

69
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,291
we could truly change the world.

70
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,583
[Joanna] But behind the scenes,

71
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,792
behind that facade, things were changing.

72
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:17,792
Steve Jobs 深陷政治斗争中
Steve Jobs was involved in palace politics.

73
00:07:17,792 --> 00:07:20,792
That was much bigger at that moment than the Mac.

74
00:07:20,792 --> 00:07:24,959
I was just too tunnel-visioned
to be able to appreciate that.

75
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:27,959
[Andy] I got a phone call, like
around 10:00 a.m. in the morning

76
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:33,458
from someone on the Mac team
saying, "You won't believe this,
but Steve got fired."

77
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:45,000
The core team was stunned.
That said, things were a mess
in many ways.

78
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,709
But Steve and John Sculley
didn't agree about
what to do with it.

79
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:52,333
Fights escalated to the point
where the board told Sculley

80
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,709
that he had to remove Steve.

81
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:01,458
Um, wrenching decision
for everyone,

82
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:05,250
both Steve and Sculley
and everyone close to them.

83
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,792
[Joanna] Since the Mac,

84
00:08:06,792 --> 00:08:09,834
really I think we were all
looking for the next thing

85
00:08:09,834 --> 00:08:13,375
-because it really
jaded us for anything else.
-[Andy] Yes.

86
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:16,667
[Joanna] Any other project
that kept coming up,
kinda fizzled very quickly

87
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:19,625
because it didn't have
the grandness of the vision,

88
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:23,834
it didn't have the grandness
of potential impact.

89
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:25,291
And now what?

90
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,792
[soft music]

91
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:45,792
Good evening, I'm Marc Porat.

92
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:48,750
Today many people believe
that information tools

93
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:53,041
are the third technology
to change the course
of civilization.

94
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:57,291
Changing our relationship
to nature, to each other,

95
00:08:57,291 --> 00:09:00,000
to the very way
we experience reality.

96
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,750
The Aspen Institute attracted
some of the most amazing people.

97
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,917
It had a place where they could
speak freely to each other
in private.

98
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:11,750
Cyrus Vance or Henry Kissinger
or the Shahbanou of Iran or--

99
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:16,000
Very, very powerful people that
you would never expect to meet.

100
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,333
Those were the people, that was,
that was the teaching there,
you could,

101
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:23,917
and in fact,
you were responsible and had
a mandate to invent the future.

102
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:28,959
Because the future your parents
handed you, that was broken.

103
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:35,750
And so that started me in the
track of saying, "What can I do
to create the future?"

104
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:42,625
There comes a moment
where for some reason
you are in the future,

105
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:47,000
and you see something very, very clearly. You just see it.

106
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,959
That's what happened to me,
and I went into the future,

107
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:54,125
and I saw the world which,
which I thought was very real
and very tangible.

108
00:09:54,125 --> 00:10:00,083
And I stood
in that moment, inside it,
and I looked around my-- me,

109
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:04,792
and it was there, it was
all there. It was basically
the General Magic vision.

110
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:14,375
It was gonna be so revolutionary
that it would take over
the world.

111
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:20,750
So this book I wrote in 1989
and this was a compilation
of, of the ideas.

112
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,333
And it was called
Pocket Crystal.

113
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:28,834
And this is
what we came up with in 1989.

114
00:10:30,834 --> 00:10:34,834
And there it is,
we really had it. [chuckles]

115
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:38,834
We definitely had it.

116
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,500
[clink-clank noises]

117
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:55,375
Business is just stories. That's what people do, they tell stories.

118
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:59,500
And they-- and the ones who tell the most compelling stories are the ones who,

119
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:04,834
you know, end up making the most progress forward and Marc was a great story teller.

120
00:11:04,834 --> 00:11:09,041
After Steve Jobs left in 1985,
a lot of people were pretty
depressed,

121
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:12,125
and they wondered what Apple's
future was going to be like.

122
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:15,458
You know, could Apple still
go on without Steve Jobs there?

123
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:19,875
Marc was one of the first people
to see that computing in
the future was gonna be,

124
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:23,041
not just about computation,
it was gonna be about
communications,

125
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:25,875
it was gonna be about content
and it was gonna be very,
very personal.

126
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:28,333
Something that you could
hold in your hand.

127
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:32,667
[Marc] And it was a telephone,
it was essentially going
to be a smartphone

128
00:11:32,667 --> 00:11:35,625
with a lot
of intelligence in it.

129
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:38,333
Imagine a personal computer,
with applications organized

130
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,417
around these personal
wants and needs.

131
00:11:40,417 --> 00:11:43,792
An object through which you
communicated with yourself
about everything

132
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:48,709
that you're thinking about.
It was the way you reached out
and touched other people,

133
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:54,166
and it was the way that
you reach beyond that
into the larger world.

134
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:59,792
Marc always came with his giant
red book, uh, and he would thumb
through the pages

135
00:11:59,792 --> 00:12:03,959
and, uh,
he was able to romance me,

136
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:07,792
he was able to romance
Bill Atkinson, Andy Hertzfeld.

137
00:12:07,792 --> 00:12:09,542
[answering machine] Please leave
a message and we will return

138
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:11,875
your call
as quickly as possible.

139
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:15,333
I saw a message on my answering
machine from Bill Atkinson

140
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,500
who was my mentor
at Apple, my hero.

141
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,792
"I just saw
the greatest thing ever.

142
00:12:19,792 --> 00:12:22,417
You got to come back to
Apple to work with me on it."

143
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:27,417
And the very next day Marc Porat
came over to my house with his
models and stuff.

144
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:30,458
Wouldn't it be nice,
if all these notes,
which are very useful,

145
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,250
I could have with me
when I needed them.
Wouldn't it be nice I suppose,

146
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:38,291
if letters that were important,
arrived, fell out of the sky.

147
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:43,041
[Andy] I was a little skeptical
at first, because Marc
is such a slick salesperson,

148
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,542
but I saw that, hey,
this is pretty cool.

149
00:12:45,542 --> 00:12:48,875
[Joanna] And when I saw this,
the concept and
I talked to Marc,

150
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,959
I got the same butterflies
in my stomach.

151
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:55,291
The same feeling that I had
when I first encountered
the Macintosh.

152
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:59,375
This book was not just ideas,

153
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:02,834
not just possibilities,

154
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:05,542
but this was a complete
and thorough collection

155
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:09,333
of the vision of the future,
scenario by scenario.

156
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:14,250
Marc said, "We are gonna
create what comes after
the personal computer."

157
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,875
"John," he said, "I think this
can be the future of Apple,

158
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,125
but I'm not sure it
can be done inside of Apple.

159
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,208
I think it's got to be
a separate company."

160
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:26,000
I helped Marc get the investment
from the Apple board.

161
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,709
So Apple ended up
spinning out General Magic.

162
00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:33,333
This was the beginning
of what became, I think,
the most important company

163
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:36,166
to come out of Silicon Valley
that nobody had ever heard of.

164
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:39,875
[upbeat music]

165
00:13:45,834 --> 00:13:47,667
[Markoff] There was this
aura of secrecy.

166
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:49,583
We knew the people that went in.

167
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,208
We knew they were smart people.

168
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:55,083
You know it had Apple's
fairy dust sprinkled on it.

169
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,709
So we had no idea what it was,

170
00:13:56,709 --> 00:14:00,083
but by the rumors
it seemed just captivating.

171
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:03,333
There's this company,
it has Andy and Bill and,

172
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,542
and they're going off
to do something.

173
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:09,959
And I was like, "I don't know
what they are doing yet,
but I know I need to be there."

174
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:14,041
I was dressed up,
I had my suit coat and a tie,

175
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,208
and I was there at about
8:30 in the morning.

176
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:19,250
I knocked on the door,
no one answered,
so I opened the door

177
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,208
and it was very quiet and I'm
like, "Where is everybody?"

178
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:26,417
And I look over and there are
two people in this office

179
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:31,083
and they had been there all
night, and they looked at me
with these dazed eyes

180
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:36,792
and they were like, "We're
not hiring." And that was it.

181
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:41,250
[Stern] Everybody in
the valley knew that Magic was--
was doing something really cool,

182
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,125
and really hot, they didn't
know exactly what it was.

183
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:52,083
Everybody wanted to be there
and people literally would
sleep on the doorstep

184
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,291
to try to get an interview
or get into the building.

185
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:57,041
[interviewer] I mean from your
perspective, is this unique?

186
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,125
Or is this everywhere in
the valley and not so special?

187
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:02,250
No, no it's
not everywhere in the valley!

188
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:06,000
The best, the brightest
the coolest, the smartest.

189
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
[Bill] Hi Megan, welcome aboard.
[laughter]

190
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Oh, smile!
You are on "Candid Camera."

191
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,458
[Megan] I was always
building things.

192
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:18,542
I come from a long line
of engineers. And so the idea
of going to Silicon Valley

193
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:22,166
and learning
with these extraordinary
people how to make products

194
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,709
and create things
and do just amazing things,

195
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:27,041
that's what I wanted to do,
it was drawing me.

196
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:36,458
Andy Hertzfeld had gotten
my name as a Mac developer,
and so he called me.

197
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:39,500
[Andy] I'm sorry to offend you
with this Non Disclosure
Agreement...

198
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,917
But he couldn't tell me what it
was, and I was just thinking,

199
00:15:41,917 --> 00:15:44,041
"Oh my god I am talking to
Andy Hertzfeld right now."

200
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,291
My parents are looking at
me going, "I don't know anything

201
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:53,750
about this General Magic.
Why don't you go to
a company you know, like

202
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:58,417
IBM or Microsoft, can't you go
there, where it's well known?"

203
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:01,333
I'm like, "No, I wanna go
work for General Magic."

204
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:05,250
He would call me ten, fifteen
times a day just begging,

205
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,625
"Please get my resume"
and he would just ask me,

206
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,250
"Please, I will not stop
until I work there."

207
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,667
[Tony] And so I go into
the interview, first thing in,

208
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:18,875
people sat me down on the floor,
ripped my tie off, ripped off
my jacket and said,

209
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:23,333
"That's not how we work here."
So I go home back to Michigan,
packed up all my things,

210
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:26,000
and put them in a car
and then I'm like,
I got to hear something.

211
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,417
So I called Dee. "What's
going on?" "We have a process,
we are going through it.

212
00:16:30,417 --> 00:16:33,000
We are gonna have a meeting
we will talk about you,
we will let you know."

213
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,625
[Dee] He would not
stop calling me.

214
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,041
Then I started calling
like every day.

215
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:40,667
I said, "please call him
because he is driving me crazy."

216
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:43,125
-[ring tone]
-I got the call.
"Congratulations

217
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:46,458
you got the job,"
and I just went nuts.

218
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:49,083
[lively music]

219
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:25,750
[Marc] Email from me
to John Sculley: "We realize
that the root of our strength

220
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:31,208
was that we understood how
people use information machines
better than anyone else.

221
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:34,166
This is our early vision
for the product.

222
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:39,333
A tiny computer, a phone,
a very personal object.

223
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,625
It must be beautiful.

224
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:46,792
It must offer the kind of
personal satisfaction that
a fine piece of jewelry brings.

225
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:54,208
It will have a perceived value
even when it is not being used.

226
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:57,792
It should offer the comfort
of a touchstone.

227
00:17:57,792 --> 00:18:02,250
The tactile
satisfaction of a seashell.
The enchantment of a crystal.

228
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,709
Once you use it, you won't
be able to live without it.

229
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:12,333
It's just not another telephone.

230
00:18:14,709 --> 00:18:16,333
It must be something else."

231
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:24,333
So a lot of people in the valley they have this idea

232
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,834
that they're, that they're changing the world and they say that a lot.

233
00:18:26,834 --> 00:18:30,041
他们有时自称「首席变革代理人」这样的
They sometimes call themselves "chief change agents," and stuff like that.

234
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:33,750
大部分时间都在瞎扯，额，
It's mostly bullshit, uh,
but they have to believe it in
order, you know, you don't make

235
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,208
a photo app and you're not changing the world with a photo app. You're just not.

236
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:40,542
It's not solving cancer,
it's not solving poverty,
it's not solving climate change.

237
00:18:40,542 --> 00:18:42,875
You know, they all have
this idea that they are
doing something bigger

238
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:46,625
than what the actual thing is,
but it's like the car,
the lightbulb,

239
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:50,458
it's the idea of
a computer in your pocket,
it's a really big idea.

240
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:54,125
This device that allows them
to access everything.

241
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,417
But back then,
there wasn't an internet,

242
00:18:56,417 --> 00:18:58,917
there wasn't the worldwide
network of information.

243
00:18:58,917 --> 00:19:01,542
There weren't people using it,
there wasn't cell phones then,

244
00:19:01,542 --> 00:19:05,333
'cause there wasn't, you know,
wireless, like everything
there wasn't, wasn't.

245
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:08,333
The reason I started
covering it, was because
when I saw it, I was like, "Oh!

246
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:15,458
This is where it leads."
The idea of mobile computing,
uhm, started at General Magic.

247
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,792
-Hi guys, I've got the chips
from Motorola.
-Yeah.

248
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:19,917
[man] Yay, all right, all right.

249
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:23,583
Cool.

250
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,667
-[laughter]
-[chattering]

251
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:31,542
When you started to hear about
the different people that were
also there, it was like

252
00:19:31,542 --> 00:19:33,875
Dan Winkler?
Dan Winkler's here? I know Dan

253
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:37,500
I would read all of his books!
There was Scott Knaster,
Jimmy Freelander,

254
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,667
Susan Kare, "They're here too?"

255
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:41,583
Uhm, what am I doing right now?
Uhm...

256
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:44,333
Picking that "Paradigm" movie.

257
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:47,208
[Tony] And then, all of
a sudden,
Andy Hertzfeld walks by,

258
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:50,542
Joanna Hoffman walks by,
and you're like,
"Oh my god!" You know.

259
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:54,125
"Aah," you know,
you're resonating, like
the rock stars are here.

260
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:58,250
-[Tony] And then they just sit
down on the floor next to you!
-How are you doing?

261
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,542
[Tony] It wasn't just the best
of the Apple of the 80's.

262
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:05,875
It was the best of Apple early
90's that were all coming.

263
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:08,208
And here is this whole
team of people bubbling

264
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,417
and bursting, you know,
and I'm still trying to
figure out how to get along.

265
00:20:11,417 --> 00:20:16,667
I have this kind of longer hair
and I got my high tops
from Detroit.

266
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:20,417
I was the lowest guy on the
totem pole, you know, "Give him
some stuff and try things."

267
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:23,750
-I was worried the chips
had bugs in them.
-Cut your hands.

268
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:28,250
[Amy] I was only going into
engineering because I knew that
it would be like a tool kit

269
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,375
I could use until
someone would hire me.

270
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,750
But then I got into it, and
it turns out, oh jeez, you know,

271
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:36,500
like I was actually really
good at circuit design, like
who knew, you know, who knew?

272
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,375
The service I would most like to
see would be a shopping service.

273
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,667
I could order everything,
from my Teletouch.

274
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:44,583
[Megan] A lot of times people
in their twenties are out,
you know,

275
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:47,125
in the bars and hanging out,
but our twenties are spent

276
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:52,959
you know, just powering through,
with each other, building these
extraordinary things together.

277
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:57,542
-...the camera.
-[indistinct chattering]

278
00:20:57,542 --> 00:21:00,291
-[all] Ooh!
-[woman] Tony, was that you?

279
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,750
You know, I hadn't had that many
first days of jobs before

280
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:06,625
and I wondered, "Is the first
day of every job like this?"

281
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:09,959
-The answer to that is no.
-[Tony] Zed,
the cell broke open.

282
00:21:09,959 --> 00:21:13,125
I met Andy Hertzfeld
for the first time,
he was already famous, I knew

283
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:17,709
what he looked like. In my world
he was one of the superstars,
and it is a little embarrassing

284
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:20,208
to put it this way, but that
was, that was pretty much like
falling in love.

285
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:24,625
-[laughter]
-OK! Let's-- let's try to, uh,
start the meeting,

286
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:29,250
the-- the first, uh,
the first obvious thing
to mention is-- is

287
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:33,417
that we are not alone here
today. we're being filmed
for posterity.

288
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:37,333
It'll be a good historical or hysterical document, uh,

289
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,500
some time in the future anyway, and so...

290
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,166
Well, I was the black sheep. I was a filmmaker.

291
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,959
I'd never heard of a startup.

292
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:46,500
[Andy] I'm wired and wired for Sam here.

293
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,500
It shouldn't, it shouldn't be too disruptive.

294
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,792
[Hoffman] What I understood
was that these people were

295
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:53,542
doing something
so charmingly different,

296
00:21:53,542 --> 00:21:57,917
so charmingly new. So...fun.

297
00:21:57,917 --> 00:22:02,500
And you could trust them
because what they were driven
towards, wasn't a job,

298
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,917
the job never came up,
the salary never came up.

299
00:22:05,917 --> 00:22:09,250
It was where we were headed,
we were going to change
the world.

300
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:13,250
We all basically sat on the
floor-- no, I did not. They all
basically sat on the floor

301
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:19,583
to talk about what it was,
what are we gonna call
this handheld product.

302
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:22,792
We've been talking about
possible names,
what is the device?

303
00:22:22,792 --> 00:22:26,959
One of the things that's really
special is that it's in my
pocket with me all the time.

304
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:31,542
It's a very different thing than
computers. It's something that
is in my pocket

305
00:22:31,542 --> 00:22:34,709
and I run my life out of it
and through it.

306
00:22:34,709 --> 00:22:36,834
It was this notion of anytime,
anywhere communication.

307
00:22:36,834 --> 00:22:39,250
The notion that it wasn't
just gonna be a phone,

308
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:42,375
but you could do
all these other things
with it, to integrate all that

309
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:44,000
into one thing
that I could hold in my hand.

310
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,625
I thought, "Oh my god,

311
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:47,625
if I could have one of those."

312
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:50,750
I'm ready. And that was
how things started.

313
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,625
-[interviewer] We're rolling.
-Oh yeah?

314
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:54,083
[indistinct chatter]

315
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:59,583
-Show us what's in the box.
-Uhm. OK.

316
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:03,250
We are trying to make something
that people love. We need it
to be like your watch,

317
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:07,458
you know, it feels like you're
saying your watch, your glasses,
your, your, um, your wallet.

318
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:10,333
Something that you like
the color, you like
the way it feels.

319
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:15,000
You know this is a huge, ugly
thing, but, um, we had to
start somewhere, we had to start

320
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,041
with components that we could
buy off the shelf because
you're--

321
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:22,625
you're working from, uh--
You're working from wishes
and ideas

322
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:25,083
of how you wish it would be
and real components

323
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:28,000
that you can buy that are cheap
enough that you can make the
product reasonable

324
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,792
so people can afford it
because if it cost
a million dollars, forget it.

325
00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:32,959
[interviewer] Was that the first
one or the begin--
in the beginning?

326
00:23:32,959 --> 00:23:36,083
This is in the very beginning
and, um, one of the problems
with this,

327
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:39,125
was that the touchscreen
was extremely noisy.

328
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:43,041
And it just didn't have
the resolution, it would
be a horrible experience

329
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:46,417
for people to use this thing.
So that was actually
our hardest component.

330
00:23:46,417 --> 00:23:49,959
We were pushing the envelope
on every single front,

331
00:23:49,959 --> 00:23:53,166
so we're figuring out what size
should it be, what sensor,

332
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:57,166
what electric plug should
it have, how many buttons
should we have if any.

333
00:23:57,166 --> 00:24:00,291
[Kevin] The feeling was
that anything was possible.
You could shoot

334
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:03,834
as high as you wanted to here
and as a team we were gonna
be able to do it.

335
00:24:03,834 --> 00:24:08,792
The purpose of doing
all this, is to go out and--
and create prototypes

336
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:11,834
so that the team can
plug them into the Mac
and run the software

337
00:24:11,834 --> 00:24:14,291
behind it and experience
what a user would experience.

338
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:17,834
[Amy] The array
of personalities, they were
all like nuclear power plants,

339
00:24:17,834 --> 00:24:21,208
each one of them working on solving these difficult problems.

340
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:25,000
For me the challenge was challenging myself to try and work at that level.

341
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,834
I was a newbie. A lot of people got to just do, you know, if you're the young guy in the team

342
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:33,000
you had to learn and do. So you had to work double or triple time.

343
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,291
He was our college kid.

344
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:37,959
[Tony] I'm hooking up
a demo so that we can see

345
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:39,917
keyboards working
with the device.

346
00:24:39,917 --> 00:24:43,917
[Adler] Tony wanted to learn
everything, from everyone.

347
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:47,750
Whatever it was, yes! And more of it and how can I do more to help.

348
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:50,834
-[interviewer] Is it important?
-Uh, if you want to hook up
disc drives

349
00:24:50,834 --> 00:24:53,458
and things of that nature, yeah.
It's really important.

350
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:57,208
[Tony] I wanted to make it work
really seamlessly and fast.

351
00:24:57,208 --> 00:25:01,667
This is basically
our first test of our--
our-- basically a first demo

352
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:04,917
of our peripheral system
for the-- for the walkabout.

353
00:25:04,917 --> 00:25:09,792
And this was a technology
to string peripherals together.

354
00:25:09,792 --> 00:25:14,917
Today we call it USB,
and so we were creating USB
before the world knew about it.

355
00:25:14,917 --> 00:25:16,875
-[woman whispering] Oh god.
-[Tony] It finally works.

356
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:21,041
We decided to make everything.
I mean, we were making it all.

357
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:25,333
See right now the whole class
viewable texture is one
formatter for everything.

358
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:30,208
That meant we were custom
building every piece, it's kind
of like hand assembling a car

359
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:35,041
rather than using a factory.
And so it's, it's insane,
it's insane.

360
00:25:35,041 --> 00:25:40,125
In many projects,
you might build one or two
innovative break-out things,

361
00:25:40,125 --> 00:25:43,375
and then you build on top
of a lot of existing stuff,
you kind of stand on

362
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,917
the shoulders of giants,
and we weren't doing that
at General Magic, we were

363
00:25:46,917 --> 00:25:50,208
building the giant from the toes
all the way up to its head.
[chuckles]

364
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:52,750
We couldn't find
a touch screen to solve
this problem, in fact,

365
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:56,083
at one point,
let me see if I can find it.

366
00:25:57,667 --> 00:25:59,875
At one point, we had to
invent one. [chuckles]

367
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:03,291
This Wendell, who works for
Wendell Sander, he came up
with this idea

368
00:26:03,291 --> 00:26:06,041
of a touch screen that would be
balanced on four points

369
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:09,208
and as you pushed on it you
could, you could sense touch.

370
00:26:09,208 --> 00:26:11,750
So as you touch it
in any particular place,

371
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,000
you can do the math,
so you do the whole force

372
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,959
minus the X and Y and you can
figure out where you are.

373
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:19,417
Whether you are touching T
or whether you're touching
Caps Lock.

374
00:26:19,417 --> 00:26:23,208
-[interviewer] How small will
it finally be, do you think?
-Some day?

375
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:26,125
Dick Tracy wrist watch,
but... [chuckles]

376
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:30,333
Right now, in the beginning, we
are starting with a screen size
that's probably about that big.

377
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:35,333
Technically it was really,
really hard to build something
the size of those models.

378
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:39,041
Uh, the technology just wasn't
there yet, but, hey,
that was ok,

379
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:42,458
to build something a little
clunkier for the first
generation,

380
00:26:42,458 --> 00:26:47,208
we knew, uh,
if it caught on, it would
eventually get down there.

381
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:51,875
[Adler] The touchscreen
is a little funky.

382
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:54,041
What was this thing
gonna look like? You know,
we knew what size screen

383
00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:55,792
we were gonna have,
but we didn't know that early

384
00:26:55,792 --> 00:26:58,208
everything we're gonna
put on that screen.

385
00:26:58,208 --> 00:26:59,667
The thing
about computer programming

386
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:02,583
is you're making something
out of nothing.

387
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:04,959
[cameraman] This is not nerds
creating for others nerds here.

388
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:07,959
There is a creative
process here that is much like

389
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,166
making a film or painting
a picture or doing a play.

390
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:13,417
This is very creative, which is
a surprise to a lot of people.

391
00:27:13,417 --> 00:27:15,750
-This is a very
creative process.
-[producer] You mean artistic?

392
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,667
-Artistic? You mean artistic.
-Yeah.

393
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:19,500
I'll ask him about them, OK?

394
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,709
Yeah, that's absolut--
that got the crew yesterday.

395
00:27:21,709 --> 00:27:24,792
The common ground between
Apple and what we did

396
00:27:24,792 --> 00:27:28,166
at General Magic
in the sixties was idealism.

397
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:31,834
Our art could make a difference
in, in the lives of everyone,

398
00:27:31,834 --> 00:27:35,333
everyone you know
and everyone you don't know.

399
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:39,667
I think, uh, communications
is the most fundamentally
human thing that we do,

400
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:44,625
and that's really why what
we are doing cuts to the heart
of-- of-- of who we are.

401
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:49,291
Uh, that's what distinguishes
people more than any other thing
I think, the, uh,

402
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:55,041
the sense of community,
a sense of, of, reaching out
from yourself to someone else.

403
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:58,959
One of the things Bill and I do
is just by word of mouth
passing, passing

404
00:27:58,959 --> 00:28:02,500
that spirit down, down
to the next generation.

405
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,333
We were always saying, wow,
wouldn't it be great if we did
that and Andy would do this,

406
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:09,709
he would stay up all night
coding the thing that we just
came up with

407
00:28:09,709 --> 00:28:13,000
the idea that evening. He would
stay up all night and bring in

408
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,083
a fully working thing
the next morning.

409
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:20,709
[Kevin] So we created this
concept of different rooms,
and Andy went off

410
00:28:20,709 --> 00:28:23,500
and over the weekend
he completely rewrote the system

411
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:28,375
to implement this hallways
thing. So we come back
and it's all there.

412
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:32,959
That shouldn't have been
possible for one person to do
that much work in one go.

413
00:28:32,959 --> 00:28:36,458
[Adler] Passion is the thing
that breaks through logic

414
00:28:36,458 --> 00:28:39,750
and makes you try
to get every part right,

415
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:43,750
not because of some science,
but because of

416
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:48,250
your feeling of pride and desire
to do something great.

417
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:51,875
[Andy] All you have to do
is tap on this little letter
creating icon

418
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:54,125
and, uh, your favorite
stationary pops out

419
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:56,917
of the drawer. You notice
it looks like a little postcard.

420
00:28:56,917 --> 00:29:00,667
[Joanna] There was mail,
there was calendar, everything
was communicating

421
00:29:00,667 --> 00:29:04,000
with each other
and tiny little things
that would delight people

422
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,667
that would wink at people that
would just make it so special.

423
00:29:08,667 --> 00:29:13,125
One interesting area
we-- we haven't done is--
is expressing emotions.

424
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:16,000
Uh, what-- what extent would you
use to express anger at someone.

425
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,208
[Marc] Emoticons, today,
emoticons are a big deal.

426
00:29:19,208 --> 00:29:21,834
In those days no one knew what
it was, there was no such thing.

427
00:29:21,834 --> 00:29:25,291
Andy and Bill would disappear
and come back with emoticons

428
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:29,125
that were animated. They were
amazingly cute and intelligent.

429
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:32,208
Only one person hated
the happy face. It's like--

430
00:29:32,208 --> 00:29:35,291
-Who was that?
-[laughter]

431
00:29:35,291 --> 00:29:38,250
[Adler] I've certainly
never worked with a team as
ambitious. It's almost like

432
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:42,792
we didn't care about what made
sense. You know, how else could
it be good enough?

433
00:29:42,792 --> 00:29:46,125
There was, uh, confidence,
even arrogance there too.

434
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:49,542
[Tony] Are you kidding me?
This is, this is fun!

435
00:29:49,542 --> 00:29:52,667
[Amy] It was like we
could walk through walls
and do anything.

436
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:55,959
[Tony] Being there with
all these people who were
like, "We can change the world

437
00:29:55,959 --> 00:29:58,834
and we're going to do it
and let me show you how."

438
00:29:58,834 --> 00:30:02,166
[Hoffman] They were on
a joy ride, a rocket ride

439
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:05,083
with all the freedom
to do what they wanted to do.

440
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:08,917
Now it's getting them
to understand this thing
costs money.

441
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:14,041
Real money.

442
00:30:17,834 --> 00:30:21,875
In 1990 there was no digital
telecommunications industry.

443
00:30:21,875 --> 00:30:24,959
It did not exist,
anywhere in the world.

444
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:28,125
We were in the analog era,
there were no

445
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:31,333
digital cellphones,
there was no World Wide Web.

446
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:33,834
[Stern] We were talking
about bringing millions
of people onto a network

447
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:36,917
that had to be industrial
strength, reliable,

448
00:30:36,917 --> 00:30:40,208
and run 24 by 7 by 365
with no glitches.

449
00:30:40,208 --> 00:30:42,709
Who else could do that,
but the telephone company?

450
00:30:42,709 --> 00:30:44,959
That's who we needed,
and that meant AT&T.

451
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:53,208
[Michael] The AT&T folks came
in this gigantic stretched
limo that was too big

452
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:55,542
to get into the parking lot
and I was watching them out
of the window

453
00:30:55,542 --> 00:30:58,250
of the second floor conference
room. Watching them trying
to maneuver the car

454
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:03,208
into the parking lot.
They just couldn't do it.

455
00:31:03,208 --> 00:31:05,625
So they eventually got out
of their car and they
trouped upstairs.

456
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:09,041
We're still waiting for Bill
and people are staring
at their shoes

457
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:12,208
and a little uncomfortable.
That was not a good start.

458
00:31:12,208 --> 00:31:14,250
-Um...
-[woman] What happened?

459
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:18,125
So Bill finally shows up.
Um, he hadn't taken
a shower in a week.

460
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:22,542
He was wearing a Hawaiian shirt,
he stunk like a goat.

461
00:31:22,542 --> 00:31:25,667
You could see the noses wrinkle
on the faces of
the three AT&T guys,

462
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:27,750
but they launched the demo.

463
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:30,083
-[AT&T] This is a touchscreen?
So I can ahead go and touch it.
-[Andy] Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

464
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:33,083
[Stern] No one had ever thought
of the kind of ideas

465
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:36,000
that Marc, Bill and Andy
had instantiated in this demo.

466
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,875
...another step.
Would you like a cookie?

467
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:39,792
-Oh no. I've eaten too many.
-Would you like a cookie?

468
00:31:39,792 --> 00:31:45,458
The AT&T folks said, "We're in,"
and they joined us as
the first network partner.

469
00:31:46,959 --> 00:31:50,583
[Hoffman] You got to have AT&T,
you got to have Apple,

470
00:31:50,583 --> 00:31:52,166
that's your roots.

471
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:56,750
You got to have Motorola and
Sony, they make the devices.

472
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,083
And you got to have Phillips.

473
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:00,208
They're also gonna
make devices.

474
00:32:00,208 --> 00:32:03,125
Without those, we couldn't
have been General Magic.

475
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:08,959
[Stern] And we charged them
six million dollars for the
privilege of joining... each.

476
00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:12,250
Here was this little startup
in Silicon Valley, that was
gonna change the world,

477
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:16,125
everybody was afraid of being
left out of the vision.

478
00:32:16,125 --> 00:32:19,750
This company's scale is small,
but thinking so big.

479
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:22,667
Immediately we
decided to join it

480
00:32:22,667 --> 00:32:26,417
Yes, just, boom,
one second, we decided.

481
00:32:26,417 --> 00:32:31,458
[Joanna] Sony Japan
was unbelievably great,
but I think one of the things

482
00:32:31,458 --> 00:32:38,291
that Marc underestimated is how
each one of those relationships

483
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:41,291
contributed to an enormous
level of complexity.

484
00:32:41,291 --> 00:32:44,375
...he said we have these three
bears out there, and we call
them Goldilocks.

485
00:32:44,375 --> 00:32:47,208
-We're gonna dance
with the three bears.
-[laughter]

486
00:32:47,208 --> 00:32:50,500
-[Andy] Marc is Goldilocks.
-I find him, grraawr, grraawr!

487
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,417
-[laughter]
-Gurrhr!

488
00:32:52,417 --> 00:32:54,709
I thought you grraawr, grraawr!

489
00:32:54,709 --> 00:32:57,125
[Marc] The vision was gonna
happen because we were
putting together

490
00:32:57,125 --> 00:33:00,333
16 of the largest companies
on the planet

491
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:03,166
who are natural enemies,
into-- into the same room
at the same time.

492
00:33:03,166 --> 00:33:07,458
We knew we were innovating,
no one had done anything like
that, and if it succeeded

493
00:33:07,458 --> 00:33:13,792
it would change everything and
that took a war-like energy.

494
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:17,166
That was fighting,
that was battle.

495
00:33:17,166 --> 00:33:21,417
[calm music]

496
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:24,917
[Sculley] We had no choice,
but to keep quiet about
the things we were doing

497
00:33:24,917 --> 00:33:30,542
because other companies
were interested in it as well,
and we tried to keep secrecy

498
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:37,458
at a level that would give a
small company like General Magic
time to create, time to develop.

499
00:33:37,458 --> 00:33:42,750
[Dee] Everybody had
to shred everything. We couldn't
put everything in one bin.

500
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:49,125
We had to wait and--
and kind of dole it out
to various different places.

501
00:33:49,125 --> 00:33:51,208
We were asked not to talk
about it outside

502
00:33:51,208 --> 00:33:54,041
of the office because we didn't
want any of it leaked.

503
00:33:54,041 --> 00:33:58,041
So there was this buzz around
the company, but it really was
kind of this, this, cipher.

504
00:33:58,041 --> 00:34:02,208
We had to keep it under wraps.
Part of that was
this PR strategy

505
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:06,917
that we had only one shot
to make news.

506
00:34:06,917 --> 00:34:10,458
[Marc] "While we're
in business development stage,
security is essential.

507
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:13,625
If the concept leaks,
we lose our competitive edge.

508
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:18,417
Please use the highest level
of personal attention
to security, including,

509
00:34:18,417 --> 00:34:22,291
if asked by an Apple colleague
not on the team, say nothing.

510
00:34:22,291 --> 00:34:24,917
If asked by a non-Apple
person, tell me immediately."

511
00:34:24,917 --> 00:34:29,500
Now it should be noted,
John Sculley was running Apple
at the time.

512
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:35,125
[Joanna] In that sense
he was our ally,
or so we thought.

513
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:46,291
I was getting intense pressure
from the Apple board and from
the Apple management team

514
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:49,458
as to why was I spending
so much time on General Magic.

515
00:34:49,458 --> 00:34:54,458
And Apple was developing
in parallel a business
that it owned 100% of,

516
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:58,291
called Newton, and that looked
like they could ship a product.

517
00:34:58,291 --> 00:35:04,667
Ten years ago we launched
Macintosh, a revolution
for the desktop.

518
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:09,208
And today we are launching
Newton, a revolution
for the pocket.

519
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:13,667
John Sculley gave a keynote
address at the 1993

520
00:35:13,667 --> 00:35:17,792
consumer electronic shows
where he announced
what we were doing.

521
00:35:17,792 --> 00:35:22,458
Imagine being able to take
a cellular telephone
and be able to be paged

522
00:35:22,458 --> 00:35:26,917
on the phone and write a little
note and fax it off to someone
else in response.

523
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:32,333
Except he announced it
as something Apple was doing.
We thought Apple wasn't doing it

524
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:34,917
and we found out from
that speech that they were.

525
00:35:34,917 --> 00:35:38,375
I wish I could say
that I was hurt. I wasn't--

526
00:35:38,375 --> 00:35:42,166
I wasn't just hurt, I was angry.
I was fur-- I was really angry.

527
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:44,375
[Andy] They had, uh,
decided to make something

528
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:48,000
essentially based on
Marc's models.

529
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,166
I thought Newton was,
I thought that they could
co-exist, you know.

530
00:35:53,166 --> 00:35:58,500
And, so I wasn't really
concerned that Newton
would hurt General Magic.

531
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:03,333
They were our closest partner
who really gave us
our life.

532
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:09,959
And so when we found out that
they were trying to kill us,
we felt completely betrayed.

533
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:15,250
You wanna know about the
Newton? I'll tell you about
the Newton, #### the Newton.

534
00:36:18,208 --> 00:36:22,291
[Joanna] The Newton
announcement caused vision envy

535
00:36:22,291 --> 00:36:24,625
on the part of all
of our partners.

536
00:36:24,625 --> 00:36:28,542
They thought that Sculley's
was bigger than theirs.

537
00:36:28,542 --> 00:36:32,041
"I want that vision thing. Do
that vision thing for me too."

538
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:36,583
And so
they wanted to immediately
go up there and introduce.

539
00:36:36,583 --> 00:36:40,583
[Hoffman] We've got to explain
the vision such that
everybody gets it.

540
00:36:40,583 --> 00:36:44,375
The press gets it,
the corporations get it,
it's all clear.

541
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:51,709
[woman] Leading the way to
a new age of personal
communication,

542
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:56,000
creating a revolutionary
electronic messaging
environment.

543
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,083
We call this environment,
the Cloud.

544
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:01,750
[Stern] The fact
that the Newton was going
to ship and it was getting

545
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:04,875
all this publicity meant
that we had to come out
of stealth mode

546
00:37:04,875 --> 00:37:08,667
earlier than we had planned
and well before we were
ready to ship.

547
00:37:08,667 --> 00:37:12,625
Stakes are higher, you better
be better than these guys.

548
00:37:12,625 --> 00:37:16,250
[Marc] Big event? This was
huge and we made it huge

549
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:18,333
on purpose to raise
the jeopardy.

550
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:22,250
We knew it was gonna be
a marathon that we were
gonna run at sprint speed.

551
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:27,417
It was gonna take everything
out of us. Down the torpedoes,
it's full speed ahead.

552
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:33,625
This is it, we're coming,
these amazing devices.

553
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:36,792
[dramatic music]

554
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,792
-[Markoff] You remember
much about that day?
-[Saffo] Yeah, well,

555
00:37:42,792 --> 00:37:45,625
I remember my impression
of Marc was, "Huh,

556
00:37:45,625 --> 00:37:50,792
most of the vision of Jobs,
but he had better interface".

557
00:37:50,792 --> 00:37:52,792
[announcer]
Presenting Marc Porat.

558
00:37:52,792 --> 00:37:54,291
[audience applauding]

559
00:37:54,291 --> 00:37:56,125
Today we are going
to introduce the vision.

560
00:37:56,125 --> 00:38:00,458
Today we are introducing
the technology,
introducing The Alliance.

561
00:38:00,458 --> 00:38:02,792
But let it be said
it's about feelings.

562
00:38:02,792 --> 00:38:07,458
How you feel about
the communication
with another person.

563
00:38:07,458 --> 00:38:10,667
To me the relationships
of your life, is the fabric
of your life.

564
00:38:10,667 --> 00:38:14,250
That's the stuff that defines
who we are as people.

565
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,166
[MacAskill] Marc was one of
the most charismatic presenters
you could ever imagine.

566
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:21,458
But let me just hold it up for
you, so you can see what this
thing is, you know, about.

567
00:38:21,458 --> 00:38:23,500
Its intent is to be
with me all the time.

568
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,834
The thing about Porat
when he speaks is,
everybody in the audience

569
00:38:26,834 --> 00:38:31,000
says to themselves
two things, they say,
"My god this guy is right.

570
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,583
I can go to
the roof of this building
and if I jump, I will fly."

571
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:40,625
And the second thing
they would think is,
"And that guy up there on stage,

572
00:38:40,625 --> 00:38:44,625
and me, we're the only
two guys who really get it."

573
00:38:44,625 --> 00:38:48,375
This, we hope will be
with you as simply part
of your existence.

574
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:52,125
It will be that useful.
The minute I see it in a store,
I smile.

575
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:55,583
It's about having fun,
it's about leisure,
it's about entertainment.

576
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:59,291
I just recall listening to him
and thinking, "Yes, yes!"

577
00:38:59,291 --> 00:39:04,375
When we were talking
about re-inventing telephony,
we meant it. This is inexorable.

578
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:08,125
The world of personal
communications, when it's
fulfilled, uh, possibly

579
00:39:08,125 --> 00:39:12,291
in one generation, when I say
generation, I mean my children,
my son and daughter.

580
00:39:12,291 --> 00:39:14,500
When they walk
around with these things
they will be wireless.

581
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,375
[Hershenson] Reporters would
leave these briefings saying,

582
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:20,000
"My god, uh, forget the story
I'm writing, I want that.

583
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,709
The world that they just
described to me,

584
00:39:22,709 --> 00:39:25,709
I want to live in that world,
I want my kids to live
in that world."

585
00:39:25,709 --> 00:39:28,875
[reporter 1] A tiny gadget
that combines the telephone,

586
00:39:28,875 --> 00:39:31,625
a fax machine,
and a personal computer.

587
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:34,250
Cellular phone,
a pocket pager and a notepad.

588
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:37,166
Sounds a bit like
something from Star Trek, you
can send and receive messages,

589
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:42,250
order tickets, get the latest
headlines or stock quotes
and also you can talk on it.

590
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:46,667
It was wall to wall coverage.
New York times, Wall Street
Journal, L.A. Times.

591
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:48,583
[Hoffman] It was front page
in the Economist,

592
00:39:48,583 --> 00:39:51,542
front page on the Wall Street
Journal. No small thing.

593
00:39:51,542 --> 00:39:54,625
[reporter] If this works
the way this industry
wants it to work,

594
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:57,959
this is going to be huge,
I mean, you are talking about

595
00:39:57,959 --> 00:40:01,375
the potential for hundreds of
millions of devices eventually.

596
00:40:01,375 --> 00:40:05,709
IBM is conspicuously absent from
the alliance. So is Microsoft,

597
00:40:05,709 --> 00:40:10,250
which is racing to develop
its own personal communicating
software standard.

598
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:15,709
[reporter] Some say
it's revolutionary.
Others simply say it's magic.

599
00:40:15,709 --> 00:40:17,709
So we got a ton of coverage,
a ton of coverage,

600
00:40:17,709 --> 00:40:21,166
and that's also where,
the first questions where,

601
00:40:21,166 --> 00:40:22,792
"Well, this is, this is huge.

602
00:40:22,792 --> 00:40:26,000
Are they going to be able
to actually fulfill
on that vision?"

603
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,917
[radio host] Marc Porat
the President and CEO
and co-founder of General Magic.

604
00:40:29,917 --> 00:40:34,667
Thank you very much for being
here. What do you see as your--
your startup date

605
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:37,458
to actually have one of these
things in somebody's hand?

606
00:40:37,458 --> 00:40:40,291
[Marc Porat on the phone]
We'll be talking about dates
and about product features

607
00:40:40,291 --> 00:40:43,625
in some detail this summer,
but I did want to have a chance
to answer your--

608
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:45,834
In other words nobody is saying
when one of these is gonna be
available?

609
00:40:45,834 --> 00:40:47,625
-[Marc Porat] That's correct.
-OK, OK. So--

610
00:40:47,625 --> 00:40:50,458
[Marc] I caution--
I-- I-- I counsel caution...

611
00:40:50,458 --> 00:40:54,250
[Adler] ...written record of it.
Um, but what we have,
we have sort of...

612
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:57,000
It did not go smoothly
after that at all.

613
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,208
Moments where somebody has
to start doing something and,
uh, what we have decided is

614
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:03,750
that for each of those important
moments we want to make sure
that there is

615
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:06,959
real responsibility for someone
to, you know, to-- to say,

616
00:41:06,959 --> 00:41:09,250
"I am at this important moment,
you'll start doing your work."

617
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:14,333
Marc and Bill
and Andy together decided,
"Well, this is the person

618
00:41:14,333 --> 00:41:18,667
to manage the engineering team."
That's what they-- that's what
they wanted me to do.

619
00:41:18,667 --> 00:41:20,834
And then there was
this one day where
I came to talk to all of them

620
00:41:20,834 --> 00:41:24,125
at once and they said,
"Oh we don't need a manager.

621
00:41:24,125 --> 00:41:28,458
We don't want you, because
we don't need a manager.
Our leader, our leaders

622
00:41:28,458 --> 00:41:33,166
are Andy and Bill. Uh, that's
what makes this place great,
is we don't have managers."

623
00:41:33,166 --> 00:41:37,125
[Tony] "We can be
engineers without a manager
and we know what's best.

624
00:41:37,125 --> 00:41:41,000
Managers are just going to get
in the way. We don't need
program managers,

625
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,667
we don't need any of that stuff.
We are just going to
make it happen."

626
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,709
[engine revving]

627
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:53,834
[Marc] There was a fearlessness
and a sense of correctness,

628
00:41:53,834 --> 00:41:58,375
no questioning
of "Could I be wrong?" None.

629
00:41:58,375 --> 00:42:01,542
Because that's what
you need to break
out of earth's gravity,

630
00:42:01,542 --> 00:42:04,667
you need-- you need
an enormous amount of momentum.

631
00:42:04,667 --> 00:42:08,166
And that momentum comes
from suppressing introspection

632
00:42:08,166 --> 00:42:10,583
about the possibility
of failure.

633
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:14,834
[Stern] The Alliance was the
biggest and most complicated

634
00:42:14,834 --> 00:42:17,709
consortium of global companies
that had been created

635
00:42:17,709 --> 00:42:19,375
up until that time
in American business.

636
00:42:19,375 --> 00:42:20,583
You had competitors
at the table.

637
00:42:20,583 --> 00:42:22,583
Sony and Panasonic
hated each other,

638
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:24,250
and it made it
hard for them to commit

639
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,125
fully to our business.

640
00:42:26,125 --> 00:42:27,959
We needed to become independent,

641
00:42:27,959 --> 00:42:29,333
and the only way
we could do that

642
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:31,750
was buy selling stock
to the public.

643
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:34,709
It was the first,
so called, concept IPO,

644
00:42:34,709 --> 00:42:37,208
which is when a company could
go public without any revenue,

645
00:42:37,208 --> 00:42:38,959
let alone any profits.

646
00:42:38,959 --> 00:42:42,667
What made that possible?
The imprimatur of Goldman Sachs.

647
00:42:44,792 --> 00:42:49,375
Goldman Sachs was the gold
standard for investment banking.

648
00:42:49,375 --> 00:42:55,417
If Goldman was going to do
your initial public offering,
it meant that you too

649
00:42:55,417 --> 00:42:59,792
met the gold standard for
being a real company
with real prospects.

650
00:42:59,792 --> 00:43:02,041
Didn't have a product,
didn't have a revenue stream,

651
00:43:02,041 --> 00:43:04,917
but, you know, it seemed cool
at the time, let's invest.

652
00:43:04,917 --> 00:43:07,667
[Marc] The best investment
bankers came to pitch us.

653
00:43:07,667 --> 00:43:13,458
One of them came and said,
"I must have a piece of the IPO.

654
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:17,000
What would it take, what--
if I gave you the shirt off
my back, would that do it?

655
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,834
And I said, "Yeah. It would!"
And he stripped down...

656
00:43:20,834 --> 00:43:24,125
-Don't film this stuff.
-[laughter]

657
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:27,625
[Marc] And there we were
standing in the conference room
with a half-naked banker.

658
00:43:27,625 --> 00:43:30,250
He got the deal,
he participated in the IPO.

659
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:33,792
[indistinct chatter]

660
00:43:33,792 --> 00:43:35,625
Where is that
[indistinct] happening?

661
00:43:38,834 --> 00:43:39,667
Right here.

662
00:43:42,041 --> 00:43:46,458
So then they didn't make
any 44260s in five volts without
this, right, enable thing?

663
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:50,250
[Megan] Probably the most
challenging part of the product
was deciding what not to do.

664
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:53,166
What to do and what not to do,
because it's really hard,
you're building

665
00:43:53,166 --> 00:43:58,291
a very complex platform.
And so just often things
would take longer.

666
00:43:58,291 --> 00:44:02,166
For me, I had never
done anything like that.
It was a huge challenge.

667
00:44:02,166 --> 00:44:06,875
You really had to work very hard
to build what we were
trying to build.

668
00:44:08,834 --> 00:44:12,583
I really had to up my game
and they were all like,
"Fadell you're doing it wrong.

669
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:15,667
You should be doing it
that way." And I'm like, "No,
I think it's the right way."

670
00:44:15,667 --> 00:44:18,166
But I couldn't really articulate
the way they could. So yeah,

671
00:44:18,166 --> 00:44:22,333
-I had to challenge myself
and kinda go into the dark hole.
-A3 Volts...

672
00:44:22,333 --> 00:44:25,709
[Megan] Once we got the basics
there, you take the new chip
that had

673
00:44:25,709 --> 00:44:29,750
whatever the latest software
that everybody had put together,

674
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:33,291
pop it in and begin to see
the screen come to life.

675
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:37,000
[keyboard clicking]

676
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,375
[Amy] We could see it,
we could touch it and feel it.

677
00:44:41,375 --> 00:44:46,083
But the responsiveness of
the device was really slow. Uh,
the processor was underpowered,

678
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:52,375
for example. So the experience
was a bit tap... tap...

679
00:44:52,375 --> 00:44:54,458
And, you know, kind of annoying.

680
00:44:56,375 --> 00:45:00,083
I was sitting in a lot
of the user test labs.

681
00:45:00,083 --> 00:45:03,041
The engineers would sit there
and say, "No, lady,
what are you doing?

682
00:45:03,041 --> 00:45:06,083
Don't, don't tap that. No, it's
not there, it's over there!"

683
00:45:06,083 --> 00:45:09,083
And we'd all go, "Ooh."
There was some comedy there.

684
00:45:09,083 --> 00:45:12,083
[woman 1] The thing
at the bottom that kinda
looks like a comb,

685
00:45:12,083 --> 00:45:15,917
I haven't the slightest idea
what that is.

686
00:45:15,917 --> 00:45:17,667
[man] This doesn't look
like it's working.

687
00:45:17,667 --> 00:45:19,542
-[chimes]
-[woman] Is this noise
supposed to be here?

688
00:45:19,542 --> 00:45:21,917
-[engineer] OK, we've crashed.
We just crashed.
-[woman] Uh-oh.

689
00:45:21,917 --> 00:45:24,083
[Hershenson]
It had this little top hat.

690
00:45:24,083 --> 00:45:26,542
Like some operating systems
had little spinning wheels

691
00:45:26,542 --> 00:45:28,917
or a top hat would
just start spinning.

692
00:45:28,917 --> 00:45:30,959
And just start spinning
and just keep spinning.

693
00:45:30,959 --> 00:45:33,542
You just stare
at this ####### thing.

694
00:45:33,542 --> 00:45:36,250
Finally you just pull out
the battery and reset
the device,

695
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:38,333
because there is
no point in waiting.

696
00:45:38,333 --> 00:45:41,750
-[beeping]
-[indistinct] target for
re-bunking.

697
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:44,583
[engineer] It's not my fault,
is it? It's the software
engineer.

698
00:45:44,583 --> 00:45:49,208
And, you know, it's slowly
dawning on us, like we are not
gonna get this done.

699
00:45:49,208 --> 00:45:52,000
[woman 1] This isn't a finished
program by any means, is it?

700
00:45:57,959 --> 00:46:01,166
[Stern] The roadshow for
the General Magic
public offering

701
00:46:01,166 --> 00:46:04,792
was flying around in a private
jet, flying first class,

702
00:46:04,792 --> 00:46:10,291
staying in the best hotels and
having people sit at our feet
and lap up what we were saying.

703
00:46:10,291 --> 00:46:12,625
The closest thing it comes to
is touring with a rock band.

704
00:46:12,625 --> 00:46:16,125
We've got a roadie crew
that has to set up
the cameras and the big screen

705
00:46:16,125 --> 00:46:18,709
to make sure that people
can see the demonstration
of the device.

706
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:24,583
What we envisioned is something
in your hand that's with you
all the time, that allows you

707
00:46:24,583 --> 00:46:29,625
to have access whether it's
for fun or more importantly for
mission critical applications.

708
00:46:29,625 --> 00:46:31,333
[audience applauding]

709
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:33,709
All we did was
demonstrate the device.

710
00:46:33,709 --> 00:46:38,792
I would go out in the hallway
and I would pretend to be
an airline company

711
00:46:38,792 --> 00:46:44,166
and Marc would make an airline
reservation, and in real time,
Marc would reserve a flight,

712
00:46:44,166 --> 00:46:47,667
and blow people away
because no one had ever
seen anything like it.

713
00:46:47,667 --> 00:46:49,959
We've got tools,
we've got partners.

714
00:46:49,959 --> 00:46:51,542
We've got markets that are
happening all around us.

715
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:53,625
-Give us a clap.
-[audience applauding]

716
00:46:53,625 --> 00:46:56,583
Great. That's the right stuff.

717
00:46:56,583 --> 00:47:01,333
[Stern] The roadshow succeeded
beyond everybody's wild
expectations.

718
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:04,208
The first concept public
offering in Silicon Valley
history

719
00:47:04,208 --> 00:47:08,959
and we raised a total of, uh,
96 million dollars.

720
00:47:08,959 --> 00:47:09,875
That's about as good
as it gets.

721
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,041
We were kings of the universe,
and it was really fun.

722
00:47:19,875 --> 00:47:23,417
[Marc] Today we would call it
going viral. The press loved us.

723
00:47:23,417 --> 00:47:26,375
They heard the vision,
they saw what was going on,
and whoop! They're in.

724
00:47:26,375 --> 00:47:29,709
[MacAskill]
I was just afraid Marc thought
things were just too easy to do.

725
00:47:29,709 --> 00:47:32,375
How are you gonna get
the price point? How are you
gonna keep it from crashing?

726
00:47:32,375 --> 00:47:34,875
How are you gonna make it
fast enough? How are you
gonna make it readable?

727
00:47:34,875 --> 00:47:37,208
I just didn't think
he was focused on that stuff.

728
00:47:37,208 --> 00:47:41,208
[Tony] We were so distracted
by all the articles,

729
00:47:41,208 --> 00:47:45,417
that we started to believe
our own-- our own tale.

730
00:47:45,417 --> 00:47:48,792
You know that we're
gonna conquer the world,
but yet we hadn't finished.

731
00:47:48,792 --> 00:47:53,291
We were not paying attention
to the other external trends
that were happening around us,

732
00:47:53,291 --> 00:47:56,542
because we were aiming
so far out in the future.
It was like the--

733
00:47:56,542 --> 00:48:00,083
the current context around us
really wasn't considered
that relevant,

734
00:48:00,083 --> 00:48:04,458
because we were aiming to far
out. But boy was that relevant.

735
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:09,583
[modem connecting sound]

736
00:48:09,583 --> 00:48:13,583
[TV announcer 1] Put simply
the internet is just
a network of networks.

737
00:48:13,583 --> 00:48:16,750
[TV announcer] In recent years,
a relatively unknown
communication system,

738
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:20,792
called the Internet,
has exploded in popularity
with such intensity

739
00:48:20,792 --> 00:48:26,000
that it's predicted that over
25 million people will be
using it by the year 1998...

740
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,792
And we had an intern who's like,
"Hey everybody,

741
00:48:28,792 --> 00:48:32,041
it's all about the Web. You
guys are totally missing it."
He was telling us this.

742
00:48:32,041 --> 00:48:36,583
It was probably late 94' early
95' and you could go to every
Website at that time.

743
00:48:36,583 --> 00:48:39,291
There was a list of them
and you could go and visit
all of the Websites.

744
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:42,875
And it was all very rough,
you know there was mostly text.

745
00:48:42,875 --> 00:48:48,291
Uh, having graphics was leading
edge and we were working on
this rich multimedia system

746
00:48:48,291 --> 00:48:53,375
with audio and graphics
and things animating
and the richness was far beyond

747
00:48:53,375 --> 00:48:57,792
what the web was, but the web
had-- had worldwide reach.

748
00:48:57,792 --> 00:49:01,291
[Amy] This other force
had appeared and we weren't
looking at it, you know.

749
00:49:01,291 --> 00:49:04,458
We were in bed with AT&T
with our private cloud.

750
00:49:04,458 --> 00:49:09,250
The whole point about having
a closed network is that people
had to pay to use it,

751
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:11,834
and that's where AT&T was going
to generate it's revenue.

752
00:49:11,834 --> 00:49:18,291
The problem was pivoting toward
the World Wide Web, that would
have meant cannibalizing

753
00:49:18,291 --> 00:49:23,375
or perhaps even wrecking AT&T's
business model and we just
couldn't do it.

754
00:49:23,375 --> 00:49:28,875
I have to invest the time,
the time to keep banging
on the web

755
00:49:28,875 --> 00:49:34,333
with my mouse and my keyboard
because unless I do that nothing
happens. The web is passive.

756
00:49:34,333 --> 00:49:37,625
[Stern] But even though it was
all here, right in front of us,

757
00:49:37,625 --> 00:49:41,500
we were unable to see
that was the way to go.

758
00:49:43,333 --> 00:49:46,542
[lively music]

759
00:49:55,667 --> 00:50:00,417
[MacAskill] One of our
developers, Pierre Omidyar,
very quiet, soft spoken guy.

760
00:50:00,417 --> 00:50:04,750
He had a Webpage, and down
at the bottom it had a click
through called Auction Web.

761
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:07,083
Every once in a while
I would pass his desk

762
00:50:07,083 --> 00:50:09,625
and he would go, "Dee, come over
here, let me show you this."

763
00:50:09,625 --> 00:50:13,125
So he would show me
what he was doing
and of course he explained it as

764
00:50:13,125 --> 00:50:16,375
it was gonna be kind
of a garage sale, flea market,

765
00:50:16,375 --> 00:50:21,542
kind of site. OK, why do we need
that? And so... [chuckling]

766
00:50:21,542 --> 00:50:23,917
[Stern] And he came to me
and said, "Do you
wanna help grow it?

767
00:50:23,917 --> 00:50:26,917
You know, is it something you
think is a good idea? I'd like
to turn it into a--

768
00:50:26,917 --> 00:50:30,375
into a company possibly.
Would you help me spin it out?"
I just looked at him and said,

769
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:33,375
"You know, this is the dumbest
idea I've ever heard.

770
00:50:33,375 --> 00:50:35,375
You're gonna get strangers
to trust each other
on the Internet?

771
00:50:35,375 --> 00:50:38,458
Lots of luck. We're
not interested, have fun."

772
00:50:38,458 --> 00:50:43,917
[lively music]

773
00:50:43,917 --> 00:50:46,875
[MacAskill] He tried to get
lots of people to join
and nobody would join

774
00:50:46,875 --> 00:50:50,250
'cause they just thought it was
a flea market. I took him down
to an investor conference

775
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:54,417
in Palm Springs,
so I got 15 people in there
and seven of them left

776
00:50:54,417 --> 00:50:56,750
during his presentation,
because it was a long,
boring presentation.

777
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:59,500
He had this pony tail
down to his waist. He didn't
look like the kind of guy

778
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:02,917
who was the CEO of any kind
of company. Some investors said
never do that to me again

779
00:51:02,917 --> 00:51:07,333
because that's flea market,
you could never make a good
brand out of that.

780
00:51:07,333 --> 00:51:09,375
-And that's how eBay
was launched.
-[chimes]

781
00:51:09,375 --> 00:51:12,542
[MacAskill] We had him in our
midst, and we had no idea.

782
00:51:12,542 --> 00:51:17,125
He was, he was a tech support
engineer and a very quiet guy.
We had no idea.

783
00:51:19,667 --> 00:51:23,417
[Hershenson] Meanwhile we are
hearing about, you know,
the partners

784
00:51:23,417 --> 00:51:26,083
need a final version
to put in the ROMS to ship.

785
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:28,500
[Andy] Any deferral of schedule
is very politically charged,

786
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:33,041
so what we decided to do was
just remove the schedule
from that information pack.

787
00:51:33,041 --> 00:51:37,208
Sony was just, you know,
insistent about that, like,
"Where is it? Where is it?"

788
00:51:37,208 --> 00:51:42,208
And there's only so many excuses
you can come up with to try to
put them off to say, you know,

789
00:51:42,208 --> 00:51:46,166
"Just a little bit longer,
just a little bit longer."
They're losing patience.

790
00:51:46,166 --> 00:51:48,792
[General Magic engineer]
Hope to deliver that
by December 1st.

791
00:51:48,792 --> 00:51:52,917
Uh, we're still evaluating that,
to see whether we can
meet that date.

792
00:51:52,917 --> 00:51:55,250
And then we started
blowing schedules.

793
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:57,333
It's... uh,
it's in development right now.

794
00:51:57,333 --> 00:52:00,458
We expect to be delayed
by approximately one quarter.

795
00:52:00,458 --> 00:52:03,125
-What is going on here?
-[GM engineer] I've
just gotten a little sick

796
00:52:03,125 --> 00:52:06,792
of all this complaining about
our schedule slips, dammit.
We do a good job here.

797
00:52:06,792 --> 00:52:10,375
We are a little slow sometimes
and we have a lot of bugs,
but so what?

798
00:52:10,375 --> 00:52:13,750
I started to understand
where the cracks
were starting to begin

799
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:17,500
and where we didn't have a real
message, and a real clear
what we were building,

800
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:20,250
and what we weren't building,
and for whom, and for how much

801
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:22,667
was it gonna cost,
and when it was going to ship.

802
00:52:22,667 --> 00:52:25,500
[Andy] This is kind of the pet
shop where the animals are kept,

803
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:28,125
and the animals have different
behavior when you pick them up.

804
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:31,875
When I pick the cat up, it kind
of scrunches up against

805
00:52:31,875 --> 00:52:36,041
the glass and when
I drop him, he tumbles.

806
00:52:36,041 --> 00:52:39,333
[Hershenson] These really
creative people, but they would
have these flights of fancy.

807
00:52:39,333 --> 00:52:41,709
I mean, they would just go off
in all kinds of crazy directions

808
00:52:41,709 --> 00:52:47,333
and they were amazing ideas,
but, dudes, we got to ship
a product at the end of the day.

809
00:52:47,333 --> 00:52:51,458
And during that time,
the Newton shipped.

810
00:52:51,458 --> 00:52:53,917
[Apple engineer] Ladies
and gentleman, Newton is here.

811
00:52:53,917 --> 00:52:57,709
[Sculley] Newton was the product
that was ready to go.

812
00:52:57,709 --> 00:53:00,041
It was all about
new technologies.

813
00:53:00,041 --> 00:53:03,709
The most important thing
that I've ever been involved
with in my entire life.

814
00:53:03,709 --> 00:53:06,333
[Hershenson] It's bad enough you
get betrayed by them, but now

815
00:53:06,333 --> 00:53:09,667
they're gonna try to
put you out of business.

816
00:53:09,667 --> 00:53:13,375
[ominous music]

817
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:18,750
[Marc] There was always
something else to be tuned up,

818
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:20,375
there was some bug
to be caught,

819
00:53:20,375 --> 00:53:22,291
there was some memory leak
to be plugged up

820
00:53:22,291 --> 00:53:25,291
and the date got later
and later and later.

821
00:53:26,041 --> 00:53:27,709
I'd made commitments.

822
00:53:27,709 --> 00:53:29,291
The company had made
commitments,

823
00:53:29,291 --> 00:53:31,583
and the commitments
were now being undone

824
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:35,667
by our inability, or maybe
even cultural unwillingness

825
00:53:35,667 --> 00:53:38,166
to let something out the door
that wasn't like perfect.

826
00:53:38,166 --> 00:53:43,250
And I felt the first wave,
that first zap of terror.

827
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:46,667
We were too dazzled by
what it could possibly do

828
00:53:46,667 --> 00:53:51,625
to kind of realize
we were biting off
more than we could chew.

829
00:53:51,625 --> 00:53:56,208
I was still in creative mode,
working on a flipping coin,

830
00:53:56,208 --> 00:53:58,417
uh, so the game room would
have something in it.

831
00:53:58,417 --> 00:54:02,500
Whereas you tap the coin and it
would flip around heads or tails

832
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:05,417
and gave you a random number
for feedback and all.

833
00:54:05,417 --> 00:54:09,417
And I was setting a bad example
for the team by doing stuff

834
00:54:09,417 --> 00:54:13,250
that was relatively
frivolous when we needed

835
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:18,917
to concentrate on the boring,
uh, but necessary parts.

836
00:54:18,917 --> 00:54:24,417
And it really made me
do some soul searching
that I was kind of, uh...

837
00:54:24,417 --> 00:54:27,583
leading people astray
and not having

838
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:31,792
quite the right, uh,
seriousness of our situation.

839
00:54:31,792 --> 00:54:36,000
[Adler] The deadline
is everything, meet this date
or miss your opportunity

840
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,458
to change the world.

841
00:54:37,458 --> 00:54:39,166
I don't think we had
anyone saying that.

842
00:54:39,166 --> 00:54:44,083
I was like,
"Huh... OK, I'm not crazy,

843
00:54:44,083 --> 00:54:47,458
I love all the people I work
with, but something
ain't right."

844
00:54:49,417 --> 00:54:53,125
My heroes, these icons,
that I know as people now,

845
00:54:53,125 --> 00:54:55,834
how are they letting
this happen?

846
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:57,458
Don't they see? Don't--

847
00:54:57,458 --> 00:54:59,542
Aren't they listening?
Kind of like parents, right?

848
00:54:59,542 --> 00:55:02,792
At some point when you grow up,
your parents can do no wrong,

849
00:55:02,792 --> 00:55:05,583
and then they can only do wrong.
It was kind of that same thing.

850
00:55:05,583 --> 00:55:09,333
I grew up as a person,
and these people who I saw

851
00:55:09,333 --> 00:55:13,041
as parents and as educators
started to become

852
00:55:13,041 --> 00:55:17,625
you know, humans as well
in my eye, not just icons.

853
00:55:17,625 --> 00:55:21,667
And that's when it kind
of flipped for me like,
"I can't just follow

854
00:55:21,667 --> 00:55:25,500
the leader anymore. You need
to be a leader yourself."

855
00:55:35,041 --> 00:55:39,917
[Marc] One night,
Sunday I think, and I walk
into the building and I hear

856
00:55:39,917 --> 00:55:44,125
slam, slam, bang, bang, bang.
No idea what was going on,
no idea.

857
00:55:44,125 --> 00:55:47,542
And just banging away
building what looked
to me like bunk beds.

858
00:55:47,542 --> 00:55:50,875
I said, "Guys, what, what are
you doing here?" They said,
"We're building bunk beds."

859
00:55:50,875 --> 00:55:55,875
Why do you need to build
a bunk bed in your office?
Why don't you go home to sleep?

860
00:55:55,875 --> 00:55:58,667
[Tony] We had to
go up against it,
pull it together to get

861
00:55:58,667 --> 00:56:02,333
something out the door.
We've got to get serious.

862
00:56:02,333 --> 00:56:04,583
[Megan] I remember like
sleeping on, you know,
some random

863
00:56:04,583 --> 00:56:07,250
mattress on the floor,
we didn't care about all this,

864
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:10,375
we didn't care whether
we had furniture or anything,
we were just doing this thing.

865
00:56:10,375 --> 00:56:13,875
[Kevin] So we're just working
all out all the time, uh, and
I-- I was actually sleeping

866
00:56:13,875 --> 00:56:17,875
under my desk sometimes and then
I would get up in the morning
and just start working again.

867
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:22,083
[Stern] It's night time,
people are clustered around
a handful of machines.

868
00:56:22,083 --> 00:56:25,583
The rabbits are running around
under their feet, the parrot
is squawking

869
00:56:25,583 --> 00:56:27,792
and shitting all the time.
It smelled horrible.

870
00:56:27,792 --> 00:56:34,792
[chuckles]
Uh, it-- it was dank, musty,
you know it smelt of sweat

871
00:56:34,792 --> 00:56:40,750
and exhaustion and no one
wanted to be anywhere else.

872
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:43,917
We'll have it, we'll have it
tomorrow morning, alright? So--

873
00:56:43,917 --> 00:56:47,542
[Stern] Every single one of us,
it was all hands on deck,
ship or die.

874
00:56:47,542 --> 00:56:49,709
[Hershenson] There was this
constant drum beat of,

875
00:56:49,709 --> 00:56:53,250
"We have to ship, we have
to ship, we have to ship."

876
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:56,250
[Stern] In terms of
intensity and pressure
it was the best of times

877
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:59,959
and it was the worst of times.
In some ways we were never
closer to each other

878
00:56:59,959 --> 00:57:04,792
and we never felt better
about what we were doing,
because we were getting there.

879
00:57:04,792 --> 00:57:07,250
-[woman] My fingers?
-[engineer] Uh-huh. Both hands.

880
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:10,375
-[woman] That'll never work.
-[engineer] One finger
at the other end.

881
00:57:10,375 --> 00:57:12,792
-[keyboard clicking]
-[woman laughing]

882
00:57:12,792 --> 00:57:15,917
[man] It's quick, it's--
there's a pleasing pace to it.

883
00:57:15,917 --> 00:57:18,625
-[engineer] A little better? OK.
-[man 4] Yeah, much better,
much better.

884
00:57:18,625 --> 00:57:21,166
[Megan] It's this
incredible experience

885
00:57:21,166 --> 00:57:24,917
of sort of all these different
people working, you know,
like a symphony.

886
00:57:24,917 --> 00:57:28,458
[Tony] This thing that we
imagined, now has become real.

887
00:57:28,458 --> 00:57:32,750
[Hershenson] We've done it,
and now you can see it and
touch it and use it as well.

888
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:36,792
[Tony] It's time to ship.
We need to get this out.

889
00:57:36,792 --> 00:57:39,625
[Adler] It was
one in the morning,
everyone was there,

890
00:57:39,625 --> 00:57:41,166
everyone was exhausted.

891
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:42,709
It was a classic decision

892
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:45,291
that every project has
to make like, go or no go.

893
00:57:45,291 --> 00:57:50,667
So here we all were,
in it together and saying like,
"Is this it, are we done?"

894
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:53,709
[Hershenson] Marc Porat said,
"Anyone could speak about
whether we should ship.

895
00:57:53,709 --> 00:57:58,542
Is the software ready?"
And a ton of engineers
said, "We should wait."

896
00:57:58,542 --> 00:58:03,542
Marc listened and he said,
"Our partners have given us
a deadline, we're shipping."

897
00:58:10,917 --> 00:58:15,000
So welcome to the first
public demonstration of-- of
General Magic's technologies.

898
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,291
I wanna talk a little bit
about, um, you know, we worked
really hard the last four years

899
00:58:19,291 --> 00:58:23,709
putting all this stuff together.
Uh, I feel, you know,
emotional about it.

900
00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:27,667
-Uh, people, uh, people--
-[audience applauding]

901
00:58:27,667 --> 00:58:31,917
-What I wanna do is, uh,
is talk about the, uh--
-[audience applauding]

902
00:58:31,917 --> 00:58:35,875
The incredible-- the best part
of working on this the last four
years is not the invention,

903
00:58:35,875 --> 00:58:39,500
I-- I love helping create
this stuff, but the best
part was working

904
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,792
with the incredible team
that we have assembled
at General Magic.

905
00:58:41,792 --> 00:58:46,125
This isn't the work of just me
and Bill, but the work of some
incredibly brilliant,

906
00:58:46,125 --> 00:58:50,250
passionate people that I'm
honored to be able to work with
and I think these guys

907
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:53,291
these-- We're working
with a bunch of young
programmers in their twenties

908
00:58:53,291 --> 00:58:57,667
that are going to go on to do
things that dwarf anything that
Bill and I have ever done.

909
00:58:57,667 --> 00:59:04,000
They are just incredibly great
and so, without further ado,
with, uh, great pride, uh,

910
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,458
and representing Bill and--
and the amazing team
at General Magic,

911
00:59:07,458 --> 00:59:10,250
here it is world, Magic Cap.

912
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:13,625
-[SONY commercial] It's a new
way to reach just about anyone
-[beeping]

913
00:59:13,625 --> 00:59:16,709
-...anywhere, anytime.
-[beeping]

914
00:59:16,709 --> 00:59:18,875
You're only a press
of a button away.

915
00:59:18,875 --> 00:59:22,834
-[beeping]
-Sony Magic Link,
and what it takes off your desk

916
00:59:22,834 --> 00:59:26,583
is only matched,
by what it takes off your mind.

917
00:59:26,583 --> 00:59:32,667
Sony Magic Link Intelligent
Communicator. It clears your
desk, it clears your mind."

918
00:59:32,667 --> 00:59:35,417
[Kevin] Still so very
disturbing when you, when you
work on something for so long

919
00:59:35,417 --> 00:59:38,291
and then you let it out
into the world.
It's like having this baby

920
00:59:38,291 --> 00:59:42,083
and like, have you raised it
well enough? Is it going to be
okay on its own out there?

921
00:59:42,083 --> 00:59:45,250
Uhm, it's a little traumatic,
actually to let something
out like that.

922
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:50,208
[audience cheering, clapping]

923
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:58,792
Hey, these really belong to you,
somebody asked me that.
They are yours!

924
00:59:58,792 --> 01:00:01,417
-[laughter]
-[audience applauding]

925
01:00:01,417 --> 01:00:05,959
[Marc] Whatever doubts we had
or whatever disagreements
or anything, we were on.

926
01:00:05,959 --> 01:00:09,417
We were, this was the moment,
this was the launch.

927
01:00:09,417 --> 01:00:12,709
We were gonna make it,
we were gonna succeed
and it was gonna be amazing.

928
01:00:17,917 --> 01:00:22,208
[Marc] So, what are we doing?
Today we are making
the first steps.

929
01:00:22,208 --> 01:00:26,792
This afternoon it's out there,
the devices are out there
and the service is out there.

930
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,875
[Stern] We had arranged
to have a demonstration day
at Fry's,

931
01:00:33,875 --> 01:00:37,083
a famous place
for new product introductions.

932
01:00:37,083 --> 01:00:40,083
And a few famous people
from Apple came, just
out of courtesy.

933
01:00:40,083 --> 01:00:43,709
We went into the store and all
of the, all of the demonstration
stuff was way in the back,

934
01:00:43,709 --> 01:00:48,083
behind the refrigerators, you
couldn't see anything. It became
clear that the Fry's staff

935
01:00:48,083 --> 01:00:51,834
had not been trained
on how to demonstrate
the devices, or even knew

936
01:00:51,834 --> 01:00:55,709
what they were or who we were,
or why we were there.

937
01:00:55,709 --> 01:00:59,583
[Amy] We talked about
our user as being Joe Sixpack.

938
01:00:59,583 --> 01:01:05,458
And I do remember sitting around
thinking, "You know, Joe Sixpack
really doesn't have email."

939
01:01:05,458 --> 01:01:09,625
And if that was our target,
it was very early for--
for Joe Sixpack.

940
01:01:09,625 --> 01:01:12,250
[MacAskill] I worried
about the size, I worried
about the battery life,

941
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:13,917
I worried about the 800 dollars.

942
01:01:13,917 --> 01:01:15,667
I don't even know
which button to push.

943
01:01:15,667 --> 01:01:18,458
No, I don't need that.
[laughter]

944
01:01:18,458 --> 01:01:19,959
-[reporter] You might need it.
-I don't.

945
01:01:19,959 --> 01:01:22,917
What it really comes down to
is a personal decision

946
01:01:22,917 --> 01:01:25,750
as to whether or not you really
wanna be in touch all the time.

947
01:01:30,083 --> 01:01:35,750
[Stern] My stomach turned sour
and I thought we're doomed.

948
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:42,083
No one came, no one
bought it. Nothing.

949
01:01:42,083 --> 01:01:47,375
[Marc] And so we are
waiting for the sales to happen
and the sales numbers were low.

950
01:01:47,375 --> 01:01:51,625
Very low, and there were some
problems with the AT&T Network.
So bit by bit

951
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:54,750
we began to get evidence
that this thing wasn't gonna
rocket right,

952
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:59,834
it was gonna be more difficult,
and that's the reality
that starts to sink in,

953
01:01:59,834 --> 01:02:01,959
is that, this is not
as easy as it seems.

954
01:02:01,959 --> 01:02:05,375
We had sold fewer than 3000
devices, and almost all of those

955
01:02:05,375 --> 01:02:08,834
had been sold
to friends and family
of the company and our partners.

956
01:02:08,834 --> 01:02:12,083
Virtually none
to ordinary consumers.

957
01:02:12,083 --> 01:02:15,375
I was looking at the list
of the names of the buyers

958
01:02:15,375 --> 01:02:19,458
and I recognized all of them,
I knew who they were,
and I thought

959
01:02:19,458 --> 01:02:23,917
that we don't have
a business here,
we are not gonna make it.

960
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:36,667
[Marc] Share price, that's
I think, the greatest concern
in this room and that's

961
01:02:36,667 --> 01:02:38,625
what we're going to take on,
head on.

962
01:02:38,625 --> 01:02:42,041
The explosion of the Internet
has forced a rethinking
of strategies

963
01:02:42,041 --> 01:02:43,500
across the entire industry.

964
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,959
I have believed for years,
and continue to believe,

965
01:02:45,959 --> 01:02:50,166
that the notion of taking
intelligent devices with you,

966
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:53,792
of the scale from this big

967
01:02:53,792 --> 01:02:56,959
to that small
is for real as a market.

968
01:02:56,959 --> 01:02:59,125
I continue to believe
in the wireless dimension,

969
01:02:59,125 --> 01:03:02,125
there will be smart phones,
there will be smart pagers,

970
01:03:02,125 --> 01:03:04,917
and maybe even things
like intelligent watches,
for all we know.

971
01:03:04,917 --> 01:03:10,166
It's a question of resources,
priorities and market readiness,

972
01:03:10,166 --> 01:03:12,375
uh, for us to figure out
where the sweet spot is. We--

973
01:03:12,375 --> 01:03:15,667
-[Heckler] Can we make some
money while this is going on?
-[Marc chuckles]

974
01:03:15,667 --> 01:03:18,500
[Hershenson] This guy from
the San Francisco Chronicle,
I mean, I remember

975
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,667
he just drilled me.
He was like,

976
01:03:20,667 --> 01:03:23,583
"You guys are going
out of business.

977
01:03:23,583 --> 01:03:29,125
Sony is going to drop you.
I have sources that
have told me that.

978
01:03:29,125 --> 01:03:31,834
What is the company's response?

979
01:03:31,834 --> 01:03:35,250
What happens
when Sony drops you?

980
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:38,542
You guys are dead."

981
01:03:38,542 --> 01:03:41,000
It's like, dude,
you didn't work here
for three and a half years,

982
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
pulling all-nighters,
seven days a week.

983
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,208
You didn't see the future
and know what's coming

984
01:03:45,208 --> 01:03:50,000
and, and now it's all
just in ashes around you.

985
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,500
[Stern] I'm looking
at spreadsheets, in my office

986
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:56,792
and thinking,
"In a half hour I'm gonna
have to get on the phone

987
01:03:56,792 --> 01:04:01,041
and talk to the analyst from
Goldman Sachs and I don't know
what the hell I'm gonna say.

988
01:04:01,041 --> 01:04:04,041
How do I create the impression
that there is a future here."

989
01:04:04,041 --> 01:04:06,375
Marc did it,
but, uh, I was at a loss.

990
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:11,000
The initial experience
is terrific,
and where we are headed

991
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,959
is sublime, and to get from
terrific to sublime takes time.

992
01:04:14,959 --> 01:04:17,875
-[Hoffman] I don't want
to be negative.
-Why is this tilted?

993
01:04:17,875 --> 01:04:20,458
-[cameraman] It's not titled.
-[Hoffman] It's been
a lot of hype.

994
01:04:20,458 --> 01:04:24,250
I would not say that
in the video. Where we are
starting, as exciting as it is,

995
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:26,542
is not where we are going
to end up. This will take time.

996
01:04:26,542 --> 01:04:30,458
It's a voyage that takes time,
it's a journey that takes time.
This will take time.

997
01:04:30,458 --> 01:04:33,000
It takes time.
You have to be patient.

998
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,500
[Hoffman] Perfect,
absolutely perfect.

999
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,208
You know, I just thought
as you were talking

1000
01:04:36,208 --> 01:04:38,000
how complicated it is
for you to be figuring out

1001
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
-what you can and can't say.
-Yeah, it's true. [chuckles]

1002
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,542
It's a whole other issue
I wasn't thinking about.

1003
01:04:41,542 --> 01:04:46,041
[Hoffman indistinct]

1004
01:04:46,041 --> 01:04:48,500
I was torn up, it was...

1005
01:04:51,417 --> 01:04:55,500
To walk in, there was a week,
you know, Phil actually
had to set me aside

1006
01:04:55,500 --> 01:05:01,166
because I was so distraught,
that there was a week or two
that I actually just took off.

1007
01:05:01,166 --> 01:05:03,917
I didn't even show up for work
because I was so distraught.

1008
01:05:03,917 --> 01:05:08,083
And then Phil actually had to
sit me down and go, "Tony what's
wrong? You're not you."

1009
01:05:08,083 --> 01:05:14,250
Like to go from 80,
120 hours a week to none.

1010
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:18,333
And so for me personally that
was a major rocking event.

1011
01:05:18,333 --> 01:05:23,291
Then the next one disappointment
for me is, you know, I started
design devices

1012
01:05:23,291 --> 01:05:26,959
and I started to try to mold
General Magic technology

1013
01:05:26,959 --> 01:05:30,625
into something
that I thought was sellable.

1014
01:05:30,625 --> 01:05:34,250
And so I created basically
a whole product plan,
and technology plan

1015
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:36,875
for what I thought was going
to be a successful product.

1016
01:05:36,875 --> 01:05:39,959
I go back to General Magic,
I said, "Look I have
a firmed up product plan,

1017
01:05:39,959 --> 01:05:43,542
you need to mold your software
to build this kind of device."
And they just looked at me

1018
01:05:43,542 --> 01:05:48,542
and said,
"Sorry, we can't do that.
We have other priorities."

1019
01:05:51,333 --> 01:05:57,291
For General Magic, as I saw it,
was, basically the end.

1020
01:05:57,291 --> 01:06:01,458
They were defeated.
That was the saddest part
about that meeting,

1021
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:06,000
is that, and Andy in particular
I think was the one who said,

1022
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:11,417
"We're not gonna--
we can't do this. We're not
going to do it," and...

1023
01:06:11,417 --> 01:06:13,709
they just didn't--
They didn't have anything left.

1024
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:19,583
[Kevin]
I am a particularly loyal
person, so it was, it was

1025
01:06:19,583 --> 01:06:21,542
very hard for me
to leave General Magic.

1026
01:06:21,542 --> 01:06:24,333
I was fully bought into
what we were doing, uhm,

1027
01:06:24,333 --> 01:06:28,709
and I stayed perhaps even longer
than maybe I ought to have,
to try to help

1028
01:06:28,709 --> 01:06:31,208
change the direction, uhm,

1029
01:06:31,208 --> 01:06:35,083
but it was, it was beyond,
uhm, saving, unfortunately.

1030
01:06:36,667 --> 01:06:39,750
[Stern] It looked like
a massive disaster,

1031
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:42,333
a failure, a catastrophe.

1032
01:06:42,333 --> 01:06:45,834
It was a sense of rejection that
penetrated right to your heart

1033
01:06:45,834 --> 01:06:49,208
and your gut,
and I-- I just felt sick.

1034
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:12,500
[Joanna] It was, uh,
devastating. For me it was,
it was really devastating

1035
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:17,041
and, uh, I thought immediately,
"I have to take time off.

1036
01:07:17,041 --> 01:07:22,208
It's-- it's going to be a long
time before I start committing

1037
01:07:22,208 --> 01:07:28,750
to yet another blue sky,
uh, proposition."

1038
01:07:30,417 --> 01:07:34,041
[Stern] The vision that
Marc, Bill and Andy had sold,

1039
01:07:34,041 --> 01:07:37,583
not just to the world,
but to us,

1040
01:07:37,583 --> 01:07:41,166
that this was a cool, fun,

1041
01:07:41,166 --> 01:07:45,750
lovely thing to have,
and that everybody would
want one because we did.

1042
01:07:46,792 --> 01:07:48,250
And we were wrong.

1043
01:07:57,291 --> 01:08:00,917
[whimsical music]

1044
01:08:08,542 --> 01:08:13,625
[Swisher] I think the conceptual
ideas were there, the user base
was not there,

1045
01:08:13,625 --> 01:08:17,625
the technology was not there,
the things to do on it
were not there,

1046
01:08:17,625 --> 01:08:20,166
it's like inventing
the television in the 1880's,
you just couldn't.

1047
01:08:20,166 --> 01:08:23,625
Like it doesn't
matter if you invented it
because you didn't have shows,

1048
01:08:23,625 --> 01:08:25,792
you didn't have capabilities.

1049
01:08:25,792 --> 01:08:29,166
I think there was actually
nothing General Magic
could have done

1050
01:08:29,166 --> 01:08:32,875
to succeed, because they were
at the wrong time.

1051
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:38,333
The way I think
about that, it's like a wave.
If you start paddling too early

1052
01:08:38,333 --> 01:08:41,000
your arms will be tired
by the time the wave arrives,

1053
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,917
and the wave will slide right
under you and leave you behind.

1054
01:08:43,917 --> 01:08:47,792
That's sort of what happened
with General Magic. They saw
the wave before anyone else,

1055
01:08:47,792 --> 01:08:52,291
and they thought it was coming
sooner and they got tired
before it arrived.

1056
01:08:52,291 --> 01:08:54,875
Yeah, but they had
all the right talent.

1057
01:08:57,333 --> 01:09:00,083
[Sculley] You can become
so focused, and such a believer

1058
01:09:00,083 --> 01:09:04,667
in what you are doing
that you can miss the change
of context in an industry.

1059
01:09:04,667 --> 01:09:09,834
In this case, the World Wide Web
and General Magic probably
didn't pivot,

1060
01:09:09,834 --> 01:09:15,375
uh, fast enough to the post
world after the Web,
but I missed it as well.

1061
01:09:15,375 --> 01:09:17,917
I was getting increased
pressure as a CEO of Apple,

1062
01:09:17,917 --> 01:09:22,500
by the Apple board, you know,
why was I wasting Apple's
time and money

1063
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:26,166
on these post PC devices and not
just focusing on the Macintosh.

1064
01:09:26,166 --> 01:09:28,834
The result? I eventually
got fired by Apple.

1065
01:09:37,041 --> 01:09:41,709
I learned from failure how
incredibly painful it can be
when you fail publicly.

1066
01:09:41,709 --> 01:09:44,333
It wasn't just
the little failures,
but, you know, I had to fail

1067
01:09:44,333 --> 01:09:47,542
in front of the whole world
when I was fired from Apple.

1068
01:09:47,542 --> 01:09:51,166
It really hurt me for a long,
long time, and it wasn't

1069
01:09:51,166 --> 01:09:55,709
till about 15 years later that
I could actually get my head
around and deal with it.

1070
01:10:01,375 --> 01:10:04,375
But the stories of Silicon
Valley are always the stories

1071
01:10:04,375 --> 01:10:08,291
of these incredibly
successful companies,

1072
01:10:08,291 --> 01:10:11,542
and yet here is a company,
General Magic,

1073
01:10:11,542 --> 01:10:15,959
that wasn't
commercially successful
and eventually went bankrupt,

1074
01:10:15,959 --> 01:10:20,583
and yet so much of what came out
of General Magic

1075
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:24,333
is the foundation of everything
we take for granted today.

1076
01:10:35,667 --> 01:10:39,250
[Joanna]
Failure doesn't-- doesn't
stop me as long as it's

1077
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:42,583
on a path towards
something really wonderful.

1078
01:10:42,583 --> 01:10:47,125
But with General Magic
there was a certain deflation
in me personally,

1079
01:10:47,125 --> 01:10:52,333
where I felt like, uh,
"Will I be able to do this
one more time? I'm not sure."

1080
01:10:52,333 --> 01:10:57,709
Because the potential was so
phenomenal and you could see
this is going to happen.

1081
01:10:57,709 --> 01:11:01,500
You know that this is going
to happen, and you realize

1082
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:04,542
you're not gonna be the one
that makes it happen.

1083
01:11:04,542 --> 01:11:08,625
It's even more comprehensive
than I remembered.

1084
01:11:08,625 --> 01:11:10,792
Yeah.

1085
01:11:10,792 --> 01:11:16,917
[chuckles]
Now that I look at it,
I think, what were we thinking?

1086
01:11:16,917 --> 01:11:19,542
We were trying to do all this?

1087
01:11:19,542 --> 01:11:21,625
And, you know...

1088
01:11:21,625 --> 01:11:25,208
And we thought
we could push the industry,
we could make them do it.

1089
01:11:25,208 --> 01:11:30,959
Mm...
Not there, it wasn't there.

1090
01:11:30,959 --> 01:11:35,375
[emotional music]

1091
01:11:45,917 --> 01:11:51,125
I'm old enough now
to know that it's behind me,
you know, it's-- it's, uh--

1092
01:11:51,125 --> 01:11:53,750
To create technical revolution

1093
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:58,291
is-- is really a game for people
in their, in their twenties.

1094
01:11:58,291 --> 01:12:02,500
The stamina, you're also not
as contaminated by the past.

1095
01:12:12,542 --> 01:12:14,542
More than anything else
it makes me feel old.

1096
01:12:14,542 --> 01:12:19,542
[chuckles]
That, uh, stuff I-- I worked on

1097
01:12:19,542 --> 01:12:24,083
or bought, you know, is-- are--
they are now museum pieces.

1098
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:32,917
Yeah, so there is
a General Magic device,
the Sony Magic Link.

1099
01:12:36,959 --> 01:12:40,417
Now I have thought
about it a lot, there is
a whole litany of things,

1100
01:12:40,417 --> 01:12:42,709
uh, we should have
done differently.

1101
01:12:42,709 --> 01:12:47,417
A lot of blunders that I'm
personally responsible for.

1102
01:12:47,417 --> 01:12:51,375
It was completely possible
to achieve the most ambitious

1103
01:12:51,375 --> 01:12:54,917
of our visions, uh,
but in a staged fashion.

1104
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:05,750
[Marc] We sometimes
need closure on things
that are not closeable.

1105
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:11,083
A peak experience, positive
or negative happens,
it's not easy to resolve.

1106
01:13:11,083 --> 01:13:17,625
In the moment we all do the best
we can do in the moment,
at that moment.

1107
01:13:17,625 --> 01:13:20,625
It's in retrospect that you see
what the impact was.

1108
01:13:22,583 --> 01:13:26,458
I felt, a profound
feeling of humiliation.

1109
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:33,917
Shame that I had
brought everyone along
with such high anticipation

1110
01:13:33,917 --> 01:13:37,208
and then couldn't at the end,
deliver it for them,

1111
01:13:37,208 --> 01:13:39,458
and for myself, and for them.

1112
01:13:44,792 --> 01:13:51,750
So I remember
coming home one evening,
so the kids were still up.

1113
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:58,125
"Daddy." And daddy had given
it all to perfect strangers.

1114
01:13:58,125 --> 01:14:01,959
[mother speaking indistinct]

1115
01:14:01,959 --> 01:14:07,542
And my wife said,
"Don't come home like this."

1116
01:14:07,542 --> 01:14:09,500
[filmmaker] Can you, Marc
slide over to your right,

1117
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:11,500
so you are not
bracketing the plate.

1118
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:16,959
[Marc] "If you need to sit
in your car, for hours

1119
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:20,625
or for all night,
don't come back.

1120
01:14:20,625 --> 01:14:24,500
Don't walk in the door
if you're not a person,
if you're not present,

1121
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:27,667
because, you're not wanted."

1122
01:14:32,417 --> 01:14:35,709
And you know in-- in--
it collapsed,

1123
01:14:35,709 --> 01:14:42,625
it all came tumbling down,
and the company didn't work,
and my marriage didn't work,

1124
01:14:42,625 --> 01:14:45,083
in the same 12 month period,
you know.

1125
01:14:46,792 --> 01:14:48,667
And it all fell apart.

1126
01:14:52,667 --> 01:14:53,291
Yeah.

1127
01:14:53,291 --> 01:14:56,667
[melancholic music]

1128
01:15:00,875 --> 01:15:03,667
[interviewer] Have you
told your children about this?

1129
01:15:03,667 --> 01:15:06,583
Well I'm talking to them now,
aren't I? [chuckles]

1130
01:15:06,583 --> 01:15:08,750
It's one of the reasons
I agreed to make this film.

1131
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,959
Life is ebbs and flows,
when a wave crashes
on the shores

1132
01:15:19,959 --> 01:15:24,458
and the rocks hear,
you don't think of
the wave as having failed.

1133
01:15:24,458 --> 01:15:29,792
You think of the wave as having
done its thing and the next wave
will come and the next wave,

1134
01:15:29,792 --> 01:15:33,250
and that's how I think of
General Magic. A moment in time.

1135
01:15:38,542 --> 01:15:43,291
[Sculley] It always amazed me,
because I haven't seen Marc
in many, many years,

1136
01:15:43,291 --> 01:15:47,333
you know, why there wasn't
a second act.

1137
01:15:47,333 --> 01:15:51,041
Because here is an individual
who was so good,

1138
01:15:51,041 --> 01:15:53,709
so exceptional
at what he did well.

1139
01:15:53,709 --> 01:15:56,917
Brought together
perhaps the best team

1140
01:15:56,917 --> 01:15:58,917
and the reality is,
in my mind Marc never failed,

1141
01:15:58,917 --> 01:16:03,709
you know, because he actually
did conceptualize

1142
01:16:03,709 --> 01:16:07,166
so many of the products
that we have today.

1143
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:18,000
It was a decade of failure
in Silicon Valley for me.

1144
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:23,583
General Magic was a disaster,
Phillips was a critical success,
but a business disaster.

1145
01:16:23,583 --> 01:16:28,166
Then I had my start up and then,
you know, during the start up
times the Internet crunch

1146
01:16:28,166 --> 01:16:31,333
happened and I couldn't get
any more funding
and that was a disaster.

1147
01:16:31,333 --> 01:16:35,625
So it was a disaster
after disaster
from a business perspective.

1148
01:16:35,625 --> 01:16:39,792
But from a personal perspective
it caused me to grow up
each time,

1149
01:16:39,792 --> 01:16:44,417
and learn because I was faced
with this real reality

1150
01:16:44,417 --> 01:16:49,959
of like, this isn't working
and you better understand
why and learn from it.

1151
01:16:49,959 --> 01:16:53,625
Because I had to go through that
to be able to set my--
to set the stage up

1152
01:16:53,625 --> 01:16:56,375
for what was to come
in 2001 and beyond.

1153
01:16:59,959 --> 01:17:04,875
[lively electronic music]

1154
01:17:11,083 --> 01:17:14,625
[Tony] General Magic gave us
a glimpse of what
the future could be.

1155
01:17:14,625 --> 01:17:17,667
The technology unfortunately
wasn't there at the time,

1156
01:17:17,667 --> 01:17:20,834
but those dreams,
we kept dreaming.

1157
01:17:24,166 --> 01:17:29,041
[Dee] Tony is very big on music
and he would talk about
music a lot and how,

1158
01:17:29,041 --> 01:17:33,000
how someday we were gonna have,
you know, a little device

1159
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:39,709
with all our music on it and I'm
like, "OK, why do I need that?"

1160
01:17:39,709 --> 01:17:42,875
[Tony] I loved music
growing up in Detroit,
and I was always sick

1161
01:17:42,875 --> 01:17:46,125
and tired of lugging my
CD's and all this
other stuff around.

1162
01:17:46,125 --> 01:17:48,709
I wanted something where
I could take it all the time.

1163
01:17:48,709 --> 01:17:52,542
MP3 showed up.
I was like, music is coming.

1164
01:17:52,542 --> 01:17:58,083
Next thing I know I get a call,
"We've looked at all the MP3
players, we think they are bad.

1165
01:17:58,083 --> 01:18:00,750
We think there is one that can
be done in the Apple way."

1166
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:05,417
And then Steve said,
"Now we need you to come on
the team to put it together."

1167
01:18:05,417 --> 01:18:08,041
And then I started calling
all kinds of companies

1168
01:18:08,041 --> 01:18:11,250
all around the valley,
around world.
Trying to figure out displays

1169
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:13,583
trying to figure out batteries,
trying to figure out storage

1170
01:18:13,583 --> 01:18:17,041
and then Steve was able,
and the team was able
to build on top of those

1171
01:18:17,041 --> 01:18:20,875
and make it even better,
and so we were like,
it's happening.

1172
01:18:20,875 --> 01:18:23,000
[Steve Jobs] Boom, that's iPod.
I happen to have one right here

1173
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,041
in my pocket, as a matter of
fact. There it is, right there.

1174
01:18:26,041 --> 01:18:29,834
[Tony] The Magic lesson
was, we have to ship it
as fast as possible

1175
01:18:29,834 --> 01:18:33,083
so you could learn
from the market and you
can iterate quickly.

1176
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:35,917
Every year we made sure we had
a new version of the iPod.

1177
01:18:35,917 --> 01:18:38,291
And then we added
downloadable apps,

1178
01:18:38,291 --> 01:18:41,875
games, email,
communications, wireless.

1179
01:18:41,875 --> 01:18:45,542
We had these different pieces
and I'm like this is starting
to come together.

1180
01:18:45,542 --> 01:18:49,583
I remember this,
and it was like I was
back at General Magic

1181
01:18:49,583 --> 01:18:56,083
again in a way, because it's
what we talked about,
just 15 years later.

1182
01:18:56,083 --> 01:18:59,125
This is real, Steve goes,

1183
01:18:59,125 --> 01:19:02,917
"It's taking off, we need
to put it on a cellphone."

1184
01:19:07,166 --> 01:19:11,291
[Steve Jobs] Today Apple is
going to reinvent the phone.

1185
01:19:12,792 --> 01:19:15,542
And here it is.
This is one device.

1186
01:19:17,208 --> 01:19:22,041
This has been, at that point,
17 years in Silicon Valley,

1187
01:19:22,041 --> 01:19:24,792
and we were finally able
to realize the dream we had

1188
01:19:24,792 --> 01:19:29,000
in 1991 on stage
and Steve Jobs talking about it.

1189
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,250
We're going to use the best
pointing device in the world.

1190
01:19:31,250 --> 01:19:34,250
We're going to use
a pointing device
that we are all born with,

1191
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:37,917
we're born with ten of them,
we are going to use our fingers.

1192
01:19:37,917 --> 01:19:42,834
So, let's go ahead
and turn it on, alrighty.

1193
01:19:42,834 --> 01:19:47,208
[Stern] I was proud to think
that, "Yeah, my god,
we did it."

1194
01:19:47,208 --> 01:19:51,959
Tony did it. Everything
we wanted to do, there it is.

1195
01:19:51,959 --> 01:19:55,834
and on the other hand,
I was sad that it wasn't us.

1196
01:19:55,834 --> 01:19:59,875
But I also felt vindicated
in some way.

1197
01:19:59,875 --> 01:20:03,083
That the ideas had been right,
the timing had been wrong.

1198
01:20:05,583 --> 01:20:09,750
[Andy] Steve would often call me
after like the big product
introductions,

1199
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:15,166
just to see what I thought.
4:00 p.m. I was in my office,
I got a call from Steve.

1200
01:20:15,166 --> 01:20:17,333
He said, "What do you think,
what do you think?"

1201
01:20:17,333 --> 01:20:22,000
And it was like
the worst cell phone
connection I've ever heard.

1202
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:27,333
You know it was all like,
you could hear Steve, say:

1203
01:20:27,333 --> 01:20:32,125
So the first thing I ask him,
I said, "Are you talking
on an iPhone?"

1204
01:20:32,125 --> 01:20:35,208
He goes, "No, no, no."
But I think he was.

1205
01:20:35,208 --> 01:20:38,834
Steve told me on the phone,
he thought a lot about Magic Cap

1206
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:41,375
during the course
of the iPhone development,

1207
01:20:41,375 --> 01:20:46,041
and in particular mentioned
the projected keyboard,
he had seen that

1208
01:20:46,041 --> 01:20:48,792
and used it with Magic Cap
and that gave him faith

1209
01:20:48,792 --> 01:20:51,875
that, that was the right
direction to go.

1210
01:20:51,875 --> 01:20:54,125
-Hey Zarko.
-Hi, Andy.

1211
01:20:54,125 --> 01:20:56,875
Hi, I'm in the middle of
giving a demo of Magic Cap
for cellphones.

1212
01:20:56,875 --> 01:20:59,333
It's really exciting,
it's working great.

1213
01:20:59,333 --> 01:21:01,500
-You guys-- You guys
did a great job.
-It's incredible.

1214
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:04,375
Yeah, yeah it's almost like
you are in the next room
or something.

1215
01:21:04,375 --> 01:21:08,291
-Yeah, amazing. Bye.
-Yeah, OK.

1216
01:21:08,291 --> 01:21:13,709
[Joanna] Had I thought that
it would be done by Steve Jobs,

1217
01:21:13,709 --> 01:21:19,542
if I had known that then,
I think I wouldn't have been
as devastated.

1218
01:21:19,542 --> 01:21:24,166
Because then I would know
that it would be done
and it would be done right.

1219
01:21:24,166 --> 01:21:26,959
It was very gratifying,
because it had come full circle,
you know?

1220
01:21:26,959 --> 01:21:31,125
Started with the Mac,
and had spawned General Magic.

1221
01:21:31,125 --> 01:21:36,583
General Magic progeny had
spawned iPhone and Android.

1222
01:21:36,583 --> 01:21:39,166
I mean, we can't
forget the Android.

1223
01:21:39,166 --> 01:21:41,583
Thank you for joining us today.
You know Android

1224
01:21:41,583 --> 01:21:43,125
obviously, you know,
being an open source project,

1225
01:21:43,125 --> 01:21:46,291
we consider ourselves
the shepherd of it.

1226
01:21:46,291 --> 01:21:48,750
So you see the vision continues.

1227
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:52,875
You know, if you look at
Android, Andy Rubin droid,
Andy was right there

1228
01:21:52,875 --> 01:21:57,083
with us and then he carried it
to Android and he makes it
to now where we are.

1229
01:21:57,083 --> 01:21:59,458
I mean, here's the test,
what if General Magic

1230
01:21:59,458 --> 01:22:02,917
never happened,
would we have had Android?

1231
01:22:02,917 --> 01:22:06,458
Not a chance, I mean all these
things were linked together,
one after another.

1232
01:22:06,458 --> 01:22:09,625
[Andy] One out of every five
people on the planet uses

1233
01:22:09,625 --> 01:22:12,917
an Android phone, uh,
growing every month.

1234
01:22:12,917 --> 01:22:17,458
[Markoff] The vision was true,
the vision was accurate,
the vision is the idea

1235
01:22:17,458 --> 01:22:21,583
that basically got computing
to the last hurdle.

1236
01:22:21,583 --> 01:22:23,709
The last hurdle was
when computing got into

1237
01:22:23,709 --> 01:22:25,542
the palm of the hand
of everybody in the world.

1238
01:22:27,208 --> 01:22:31,625
And between Tony and--
and Andy, that's about 98%

1239
01:22:31,625 --> 01:22:37,041
of the world's smartphones,
is those two guys who sat
15 feet apart.

1240
01:22:37,041 --> 01:22:40,709
That's pretty amazing,
and that by itself is--

1241
01:22:40,709 --> 01:22:46,917
brings such satisfaction.
It's, uh-- I can't even
describe it.

1242
01:22:46,917 --> 01:22:49,875
[Andy] First obvious thing
to mention is that we are not
alone here today.

1243
01:22:49,875 --> 01:22:55,333
We are being filmed
for posterity as part of our--
our introduction video.

1244
01:22:55,333 --> 01:22:58,083
Who knows if any of this
will really be in the video.

1245
01:22:58,083 --> 01:23:01,625
[Amy] Imagine a star
that went supernova

1246
01:23:01,625 --> 01:23:06,166
and everything
that you touch today,

1247
01:23:06,166 --> 01:23:09,125
everything you interact
with today technology wise

1248
01:23:09,125 --> 01:23:12,166
is because that star power
touched it.

1249
01:23:12,166 --> 01:23:14,166
I mean, all these companies,
and I don't know

1250
01:23:14,166 --> 01:23:17,041
if you add up the value
of those what it would be,

1251
01:23:17,041 --> 01:23:20,333
but they all had
their genesis with this crew

1252
01:23:20,333 --> 01:23:24,291
of just a few dozen people,
who were at General Magic.

1253
01:23:24,291 --> 01:23:26,959
[Adler] It was one
of the only times
I've ever felt like

1254
01:23:26,959 --> 01:23:29,250
there's no weak link
in this chain,

1255
01:23:29,250 --> 01:23:30,750
everyone on this team,

1256
01:23:30,750 --> 01:23:33,750
uh, is brilliant,
is so committed and passionate.

1257
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:37,083
What's so rare is having all
those things at the same time.

1258
01:23:37,083 --> 01:23:39,458
[Tony] When you look at
that class of people

1259
01:23:39,458 --> 01:23:44,125
and what the world
looks like today,
that was the training ground

1260
01:23:44,125 --> 01:23:48,500
for us, for what has
shaped the world of today.

1261
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:51,458
[Kevin] We all carry things
from General Magic,
in terms of our view

1262
01:23:51,458 --> 01:23:53,125
of what could be
possible in the future.

1263
01:23:53,125 --> 01:23:56,083
And as engineers
you can't help but think,

1264
01:23:56,083 --> 01:23:59,834
"There's-- there's-- Can we
do this now? How about now?"

1265
01:23:59,834 --> 01:24:04,875
I am so, so excited to show you
our work, and I'm wearing
Apple Watch right here.

1266
01:24:04,875 --> 01:24:08,417
A lot of General Magic was
imagining what the world would
be like if some things existed

1267
01:24:08,417 --> 01:24:11,250
that maybe we would make,
and that's so fun to do.

1268
01:24:11,250 --> 01:24:13,291
You can control both the eyes
and the mouth to get just

1269
01:24:13,291 --> 01:24:15,834
the right expression you would
like to send to somebody.

1270
01:24:15,834 --> 01:24:19,083
And that is so true
in so many fields right now,
you are able to actually

1271
01:24:19,083 --> 01:24:23,000
transform industries
by your work in technology.

1272
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,125
[Tony] When you look at someone like Megan taking all of her knowledge

1273
01:24:27,458 --> 01:24:29,125
and all the things she learned,

1274
01:24:29,125 --> 01:24:31,208
and now bringing it to the government and seeing

1275
01:24:31,208 --> 01:24:34,333
how the US Government is transforming through that.

1276
01:24:34,333 --> 01:24:38,417
Hello, everybody, how you doing?

1277
01:24:38,417 --> 01:24:40,834
-Good to see you,
is this my seat right here ?
-Yes, it is.

1278
01:24:40,834 --> 01:24:44,625
President Obama had created
the US Chief Technology
Officer, which is my job

1279
01:24:44,625 --> 01:24:48,125
and our team and really said:
"Come and help me using
those new methods

1280
01:24:48,125 --> 01:24:51,834
on some of these harder
problems, these problems
that are in our civic space."

1281
01:24:51,834 --> 01:24:53,792
There is the future right here.

1282
01:24:53,792 --> 01:24:55,458
One of the things
that I like to work on is

1283
01:24:55,458 --> 01:24:59,291
how to use technology
to make people's lives better

1284
01:24:59,291 --> 01:25:02,083
and sort of harness talent and unlock talent.

1285
01:25:02,083 --> 01:25:06,792
I love thinking about, uh, how magic is anywhere.

1286
01:25:06,792 --> 01:25:11,083
Uh, in everyone, and how do you pull that out

1287
01:25:11,083 --> 01:25:16,792
and really make sure that the talent that wants to do its thing is able to do it.

1288
01:25:22,625 --> 01:25:25,709
[Swisher] You know, as the human race thrives really on this planet

1289
01:25:25,709 --> 01:25:29,959
it creates all kinds of problems, education, uniting people, climate change.

1290
01:25:29,959 --> 01:25:34,041
There is not enough water, there is not enough food. What are we going to do?

1291
01:25:34,041 --> 01:25:38,667
Those can all be solved with technologies, it's just a question how humanity uses it.

1292
01:25:41,041 --> 01:25:46,500
But, the reliance on technology for everything, for human interactions is worrisome.

1293
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:49,625
Where people are, you know, you go to anything and everyone is like this, right.

1294
01:25:49,625 --> 01:25:53,166
Um, so I worry about what happens to society and children

1295
01:25:53,166 --> 01:25:55,667
and how they interact with each other.

1296
01:25:58,375 --> 01:26:01,208
You can't change the human race, yeah, but you can start

1297
01:26:01,208 --> 01:26:03,458
to educate them so that they change their behaviors.

1298
01:26:03,458 --> 01:26:06,583
And so the question is, can you take these powerful tools

1299
01:26:06,583 --> 01:26:10,208
and do something that really does help a lot of people?

1300
01:26:10,208 --> 01:26:13,375
Can you inspire a group of young people now, to really,

1301
01:26:13,375 --> 01:26:17,250
to be creative and come up with these new ideas?

1302
01:26:22,375 --> 01:26:26,333
Tonight, we feature an iconic inventor of iPod and iPhone,

1303
01:26:26,333 --> 01:26:28,542
I would like to bring up five numbers to introduce him.

1304
01:26:28,542 --> 01:26:31,667
Seven billion, two hundred and seventy nine million,

1305
01:26:31,667 --> 01:26:35,375
three hundred and ninety five thousand, eight hundred and seventy three.

1306
01:26:35,375 --> 01:26:39,208
This is the number of kilowatt hours saved by Nest Thermostat owners.

1307
01:26:39,208 --> 01:26:43,375
Eighteen, the number of generations of iPod's shipped.

1308
01:26:43,375 --> 01:26:46,542
Three hundred, the number of patents authored.

1309
01:26:46,542 --> 01:26:50,375
Three hundred and fifty million, the number of iPods sold.

1310
01:26:50,375 --> 01:26:54,750
Join me in welcoming the one and only Tony Fadell.

1311
01:26:54,750 --> 01:26:58,583
Hi, everybody.

1312
01:26:58,583 --> 01:27:03,041
Let's say, you show up now, you're a kid, you show up here in the Valley,

1313
01:27:03,041 --> 01:27:06,583
um, what would you tell someone similar to you who just walked in,

1314
01:27:06,583 --> 01:27:09,417
you know, wet behind the ears in Silicon Valley today?

1315
01:27:09,417 --> 01:27:14,417
You know I am only up here because of many people in this audience,

1316
01:27:14,417 --> 01:27:19,583
who helped me get here, and that's the magic of Silicon Valley.

1317
01:27:19,583 --> 01:27:23,250
We all started in the same place you are in today.

1318
01:27:23,250 --> 01:27:27,208
Everyone has the same self doubts and no one's perfect.

1319
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:30,250
And when you meet your heroes and when you work with them

1320
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:34,250
and they treat you as a peer, learn from it.

1321
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:37,583
Keep moving. If you're dreaming the right dream,

1322
01:27:37,583 --> 01:27:40,709
you're on the right path. I've been there before,

1323
01:27:40,709 --> 01:27:42,458
it's tough, keep going.

1324
01:27:44,458 --> 01:27:47,458
These people helped me to become the person I am.

1325
01:27:51,625 --> 01:27:57,792
How can we take this same idea of bold dramatic change

1326
01:27:57,792 --> 01:27:59,917
to help create a better society?

1327
01:27:59,917 --> 01:28:02,208
We are going to have to invent those things

1328
01:28:02,208 --> 01:28:08,333
and do it in all of these other domains that are being touched or revolutionized by technology.

1329
01:28:12,291 --> 01:28:16,583
它可能看起来让人畏惧；它可能看起来很难；它可能看起来完全不可能

1330
01:28:16,583 --> 01:28:20,083
but if you just find the right people and keep seeking out

1331
01:28:20,083 --> 01:28:24,375
knowledge and advice and keep staying open to make a better world

1332
01:28:24,375 --> 01:28:28,041
regardless of where you come from, great things can happen.

1333
01:28:28,041 --> 01:28:30,583
We judge things by the moment in which we feel

1334
01:28:30,583 --> 01:28:33,667
that they have made an impact on the mass culture.

1335
01:28:33,667 --> 01:28:37,291
They are in the anthropology, they are in the culture of how we see

1336
01:28:37,291 --> 01:28:40,291
ourselves, and how we come to expect the world to be

1337
01:28:40,291 --> 01:28:43,625
and I don't think that will
happen for another ten years.

1338
01:28:43,625 --> 01:28:46,000
I think we will build to it
incrementally and every quarter

1339
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,083
and every year it will get closer and closer,

1340
01:28:48,083 --> 01:28:50,875
but I don't think it will be until the 21st century when the stuff

1341
01:28:50,875 --> 01:28:54,542
we are working on today becomes unexceptional, unexceptional.

1342
01:28:54,542 --> 01:28:57,792
Not worth making a video about, and, and that's the test--

1343
01:28:57,792 --> 01:29:01,583
Except for historical documentary purposes.
[chuckles]

1344
01:29:01,583 --> 01:29:05,709
And, and that's the test
of, uh, of hey, we've made it.

1345
01:29:05,709 --> 01:29:06,792
We've really made a difference.

1346
01:29:06,792 --> 01:29:08,542
We've really changed the world.

1347
01:29:08,542 --> 01:29:12,417
[piano music]

1348
01:29:32,709 --> 01:29:36,250
[no audible dialogue]
